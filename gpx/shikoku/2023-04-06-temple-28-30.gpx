    <desc>The day didn’t start promising: we didn’t have breakfast since we thought that it would be a 15km day, but soon we realized that we had made a planning mistake and we had to walk 25km instead. Also, it was pooouring 🌧️🌧️🌧️. It was our second rainy day since we started the pilgrimage, but by far the most intense one.
My rain jacket for some reason decided to absorb water instead of repelling it and Maike’s waterproof and blister-inducing shoes were retaining water inside instead of keeping water out. The result? I was completely soaked during the entire day and after we arrived at our hostel and Maike finally took her shoes off, her toes were so wrinkly that it looked like she had spent the whole day in the swimming pool.
Well, at least we avoided walking on main roads for most of the day and walked on side roads amongst rice fields (where we saw ducks 🦆, frogs 🐸 and even a tiny crab 🦀). We visited three more temples (28, 29 and 30) which were all a bit unimpressive. Tonight we sleep in one of the biggest cities of the Shikoku island (Kōchi). Actually we will spend two nights here since tomorrow is a day off!!! (our first since we started walking)
