They offered us a ride \ud83d\ude99 (which we politely refused) and plenty of fresh water \ud83d\udca6.

Our host, this lovely 70 years old lady, was so welcoming and so delightful that we felt right at home since the moment we arrived. We had a great time in the evening chatting with her and another friendly Japanese guest. In the morning, after having breakfast and chat a bit more, it was time to say goodbye and start our walk to temple 60 \u2014 a henro korogashi (which are difficult passages from the pilgrimage, literally meaning \u201cwhere pilgrims fall\u201d).\n\nThe weather once more was perfect and we had a very pleasant day (even though we had to wait a snake \ud83d\udc0d slowly walk away from our path \ud83d\ude30). Some of the temples were surprising and some were a little bit disappointing, but what matters is that we visited 5 more temples today (60 to 64). At the end of the day we had to rush a little bit to make sure that we didn\u2019t miss our train (temple run \ud83d\ude05).
