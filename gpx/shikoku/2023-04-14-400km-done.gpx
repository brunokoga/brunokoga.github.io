    <name>400km done ✅</name>
    <desc>Although we didn’t visit any temples, today we had a few accomplishments: it was the first day that we walked more than 30km after we took our rest days (36km to be more precise 😮‍💨). Also, we passed the 400km mark in total, which means that we’ve completed 1/3 of the entire pilgrimage! Cheers to us! 🏆
We started walking at 6am because not only we knew the day was long, but we had some steep parts (more than 600m of elevation) and we had some rain forecast for the end of the day, so we wanted to be sure to arrive safe and sound (and dry) at our accommodation. Everything went well and even though the rain arrived earlier than expected, it was fine to hike the last two hours under a light drizzle.
Our accommodation for tonight is a whole house 🏠! We booked only a room for two (like we always do) but when we arrived here we were told that they only rent the place for one group at a time. This means that we don’t have to pay anything extra but we have a 3-bedroom house entirely for us. Not bad 😎!
And finally but not least, we received a pack of strawberries 🍓 as an osettai today from a lady that was driving past us and stopped to give us a “presentto”. We’re feeling that we are the happiest and luckiest pilgrims today ✌️🍀.
