    <desc>Day 125, part 2

Leavenworth must be the most curious village Iâ€™ve been in the PCT. Itâ€™s fully themed with a Bavarian-style (even the Mc Donaldâ€™s and Starbucks signs are Bavarianized!) and the bakeries, restaurants and saloons all serve german beer and food.

I was here for a little bit more than two hours: just enough to grab my last resupply and take another bus to Wenatchee.

The location for this resupply box clearly was not ideal, since I have nothing else to do here. When I sent it, on day 113, I was not sure of what to do. 

Unfortunately Iâ€™ll have to skip a few more miles
of the PCT due five (yes, FIVE) different wildfires that are burning ahead of me: Shoofly, Minerâ€™s Complex, Pioneer, Flat Creek and Easy.

That will take me more than one day of travel (including today). Soon Iâ€™ll take a free bus ðŸ†“ðŸšŒ to the city of Wenatchee where Iâ€™ll stay in a hotel for the night, dry all my gear, do laundry and hopefully eat a good pizza. Tomorrow Iâ€™ll take a bus to Pateros, then another to Twisp and from there take another bus to Mazama, where Iâ€™ll try to camp and get a ride to Hartâ€™s Pass (where I continue the PCT). My goal is to arrive there with enough time to chill and start hiking on Wednesday (today is Monday).</desc>
