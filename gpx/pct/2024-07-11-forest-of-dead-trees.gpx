I‚Äôm getting really good at packing up in the morning.  It took me 25 minutes today from waking up to be hiking (from 5:20 to 5:45)!

During the day I realized that there was a resort/restaurant about 30 miles from where I started. I decided to try to get there before they closed (which I wrongly believed it was at 9pm). If I could get a meal and maybe some snacks, I would be more comfortable with the amount of food that I have until the next resupply.

I hiked fast in the morning through a forest of dead trees, result of a wildfire a few years ago. Not the best landscape. I did almost 15 miles at 11am.

Once again, it was hot. Sometimes it amazes me how much I sweat and how much water I can drink. Today should be the last day of this heatwave (it‚Äôs already much cooler than previous nights now). 

I was looking for a good place to have lunch and suddenly there was this perfect spot by the riverside, with shade and a nice way to enter the river. I went for a swim and spent more than one an a half hour there! It felt great to scrub off the salt üßÇ that‚Äôs been accumulating on my skin for the past 4 days!

For the next four hours (10 miles) the path had  4000ft of elevation gain with almost no shade. After liters of sweat, I finally make it to the top, where I had a big shade break at the water source there. I had to filter 6 liters of water, since I drank 4 liters in one go.

This was the moment that I realized that the resort/restaurant‚Äôs closing time was 7pm (and not 9). It would be almost impossible to make it in time. I decided not to take the side trail there and keep hiking further. I‚Äôll figure out the food situation in another opportunity.

Along the way there were boxes with books for hikers! I miss reading so much, but I definitely don‚Äôt have the time and energy at the moment. Good night ü•±!

(I bought a bag of savory nuts to mix with my granola. I wanted to buy the plain salted nuts but unfortunately I bought by mistake a flavor with herbs (rosemary, oregano and more) and olives. I accidentally created ‚Äúolivranola‚Äù and it‚Äôs absolutely disgusting ü§Æ!)</desc>
