    <desc>Day 2
Lake Morena to Mount Laguna
PCT Miles: 21.5 (34.4km)
Total Miles: 41.5 (66.4km)

I woke up at 6 and I was starving. I spoiled myself with a 2-course breakfast. First I had a cup noodles. After that, I had fruit punch gatorade soaked granola, served on the unwashed noodles cup. I call it electronola! Delicious üòóüëå!

At 8 I started walking and the day was much cooler than yesterday. By 12 I had walked 10 miles already.  The path was fun with some ‚Äúriver‚Äù crossings. And then, the heat showed up.

The afternoon was much tougher, not only because of the heat but also the ascend (it turns out that *Mount* Laguna is a mountain, who would have know?). I arrived at the recreational campground in Mount Laguna at 18:30 only to find out that it‚Äôs opening only next week. Since it was getting dark and cold, I was a little bit desperate. I asked some people around and they gave me a number of someone who could help me. I called and the lady told me she had a tiny house with no services (electricity, water) but I could have it for the night for $20. Tonight I‚Äôm sleeping like a king!

There‚Äôs also a restaurant nearby. After checking in at my beautiful tiny house, I had a salad (cheese salad apparently) and pizza! 

I just realized that even though I met quite a few people (including a big group that I met at Scout and Frodo‚Äôs), I hiked most of the day alone. I must say that I really enjoyed my company.

Tomorrow I‚Äôm leaving with food for three days and the next resupply is 60 miles away, so I have to keep the same rhythm for these last two days ‚Äî not an easy task. </desc>
