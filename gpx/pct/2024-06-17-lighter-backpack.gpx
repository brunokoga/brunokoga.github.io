    <desc>Day 61
Kennedy Meadows North to mile 1035.4
PCT Miles: 17.3 (27.7km)
Total Miles: 1035.4 (1656.6km)

This is the last week that I‚Äôm hiking in the Sierra Nevada! The big passes are behind me and hopefully the big snow too!

It‚Äôs always amazing to wake up and have warm breakfast and coffee. For the second day in a row, I had pancakes ü•û, hash brown, eggs üç≥ and unlimited coffee. When I finished my plate, somebody from the store gave ice cream to all hikers. I was so full and very glad that I still had more than two hours before the shuttle would leave to the trailhead so I could digest all the food.

After getting rid of a lot of stuff (snow gear, extra clothes, etc), my backpack is much lighter and compact. Usually when I leave town I carry food for 6-8 days. This time I have food for four, which makes the load even lighter. I started hiking at 10:30 and kept hiking in almost one go for 7 hours. I only stopped to filter water. Rambo went ahead and I hiked with Bullfrog for a while. We ended up all finding spots to camp a little bit far from each other, so I‚Äôm camping alone tonight (and without mosquitoes!!!).

During the past two days I saw probably another 20 PCT hikers. I don‚Äôt know where these people were before, but it was nice to see new faces. The shuttle to the trailhead was full (10 people) and I quickly chatted with some of the hikers during the day.

The hike itself was super chill today. A few snow patches here and there and no wet feet! Fingers crossed ü§û that the conditions will continue like that for the coming days, so I can officially finish the Sierra section and take a few zeroes to celebrate!</desc>
