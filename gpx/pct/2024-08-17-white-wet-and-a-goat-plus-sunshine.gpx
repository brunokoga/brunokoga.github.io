    <name>White, wet and a goat. Plus sunshine!</name>
    <desc>Day 122
Mile 2405.5 to mile 2426.3
PCT Miles: 20.8 (33.3km)
Total Miles: 2426.3 (3882.1km)

It rained most part of the night and it was raining in the morning when I woke up! I think it‚Äôs the first time that this happens on the PCT.

What was certainly the first time for me was making tea and having breakfast in the tent before even starting the hiking day. I need to be in Steven‚Äôs Pass only on Monday (60 miles away) so I‚Äôm taking my time. I left camp this morning at 8:30am üòé!

It was only the second time that I was wearing my rain jacket (the first was on day 58, in the Sierra). It didn‚Äôt rain for too long, but the fog persisted for the whole morning. Everything was wet and white.

Still in the morning, I saw a mountain goat for the first time. She gently left the trail and let me pass. It was the perfect encounter.

While I was having lunch (belvita cookies with a block of cheese üç™üßÄ), the sky cleared and the sun started to shine. If you had told me in the morning that I would have sun today still, I wouldn‚Äôt have believed. Time to hang my tent to dry!

The afternoon was under sun and entirely uphill for 3 hours. At least this time I had some nice views!</desc>
