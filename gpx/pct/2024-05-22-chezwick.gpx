    <desc>Day 35
Mile 639.6 to mile 667.7
PCT Miles: 28.1 (45km)
Total Miles: 667.7(1068.8km)

It was a cold and windy night but I slept very well. So well that I woke up after 6 and didn‚Äôt leave camp until 6:40, which usually is not ideal.

It turned out though that after a few steps I stop for a quick chat with this hiker who was sitting on a rock smoking a cigarette. Chezwick is his name. He started the PCT on May 2nd (!) and is doing an average of 35 miles per day. He finishes his cigarette and we hike together for the whole morning, around 12 miles for a quick lunch break. He eats cold soaked something (maybe knorr pasta?) with a lot of olive oil and SPAM ü§¢. I eat a double cheese double peanut butter pita bread üòã.

This is the fourth time Chezwick is doing the PCT. He finished it three times already and he wants to finish this time in less than 80 days. Then, he will attempt to, before the end of the year, thru-hike both the CDT (Continental Divide Trail) and the AT (Appalachian Trail) and aim to beat the record of the fastest self-supported triple-crowner in a single calendar year! (self-supported: no assistance from friends or family; triple-crowner: someone who thru-hikes the AT, CDT and PCT)

After lunch and refilling water (third water cache in a row) we parted ways since the next part was an uphill and I usually take my time on those. After a steep climb of almost three hours, I meet Chezwick at the top of the mountain, sitting on a rock, smoking a cigarette (that‚Äôs when I took the selfie). You climbed pretty fast, he says, and we once more hike for about three hours, talking about hiking and motivation and why we do those things and why wouldn‚Äôt we do those things. Around 7pm we arrived at my camping spot. Chezwick had a quick ‚Äúhalf ciggy‚Äù pause (sitting on a rock) and we said goodbye. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever meet him again, but I‚Äôm so thankful that I had the chance to spend this day hiking with him.

On one of the many topics we chatted, I told Chezwick that I was a little bit anxious about the Sierras. There are so many unknowns and challenges that I can‚Äôt even imagine that I feel scared about it. ‚ÄúYou got this, Bruno‚Äù, he said. ‚ÄúI can see that you really like to hike and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs important. The Sierra is the most beautiful place on Earth and all the challenges will be worth it. It‚Äôs going to be tough, but it‚Äôs going to incredible, I promise‚Äù. That‚Äôs exactly what I needed to hear.

This day and the inspiring conversations with Chezwick set my mood up and made me excited about the next stage on the PCT. The only situations in the desert that I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable were related to snow and/or ice. And this is what the Sierra is about: snow and ice (and elevation and beautiful views). Come, Sierra! I‚Äôm ready for you!

Talking about records, at the end of the day I broke my distance record for a single day hiking the PCT (or ever): 45km!
