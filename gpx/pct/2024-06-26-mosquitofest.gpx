After a long night of good sleep we woke up to even more mosquitoes than the evening before. I am so glad that I don’t need to expose my butt to pee like other people here 🤭.

Head net, wind jacket and rain pants on, we started hiking immediately. No breakfast, no brushing our teeth 🤢.

The morning was a bit cloudy and we started the day going up a pass (Dick’s Pass). I was a little bit concerned about the pass because I read some reports that there would be a lot of snow there, specially during the descent. We were happy to be able to hike our own alternative route and with some zigzagging and bushwhacking we avoided most of the left over snow patches. Before that, at the pass, I introduced Maike to electronola and it was approved by her 👍!

Today we also had a more challenging stream crossing. We almost decided to cross via the stream itself but at the end we did some log and rock 🪵🪨  hopping and ended our second day with dry feet 🦶!

The downside of today were the mosquitoes. It was a plague. Miserable little creatures sent by the devil. We developed a few strategies to escape from them. The best being to keep moving all the time, even when we were taking breaks. Eating, drinking water or simply resting becomes a torture. You cannot ever stop moving. We had the company of these tiny bastards during our entire day. At the end of the day we were completely exhausted since we couldn’t take proper breaks. At least after we made camp, we were spared for dinner and had a little bit of peace to eat, finally ✌️.</desc>
