    <desc>Day 20
Mile 332.3 to mile 351.8
PCT Miles: 19.5 (31.2km)
Total Miles: 351.8 (562.9km)

What a beautiful morning! It was delightful to watch the sunrise üåÑ while packing up to start the day!

I was kind of excited about going to the Mc Donald‚Äôs  but the closer I got, the more I realized that I actually didn‚Äôt really feel like junk food. I heard that there was a ‚ÄúFruit Dude‚Äù that sells big cups of fresh fruit nearby. My plan was to go there first and then to Mc Donald‚Äôs, so at least I had some healthy stuff on my stomach.

Unfortunately the Fruit Dude was not there (although the stand was), so I went for plan B and decided to eat a Mc-anything-veggie. Except that they didn‚Äôt have any veggie burgers, so I ended up ordering two big fries, a caramel sundae, coffee and ice tea. I devoured the fries and the sunday ü§§! Finally I had good internet so I could also facetime Maike üíú.

I was not very amused with my breakfast so far. There was a group of hikertrash chilling close to the Mc Donald‚Äôs and I joined them. From there I saw that the Fruit Dude was back to his stand!

Biggest fruit cup I‚Äôve ever seen. I couldn‚Äôt finish it! It was so good to eat so much fresh fruit üçâü•≠ü••!

The next step of the day was to hike ten more miles (it had taken me 10 miles to get to Mc Donald‚Äôs) uphill and without water sources for the next 25 miles. Time to camel up and refill with 6.5 liters of free filtered water at Mc Donald‚Äôs! (this and the flush toilet were by far the best things I got at Mc Donald‚Äôs today.)

Refuelled with salt, sugar, caffeine, filtered water, vitamins and love I continued with my day. No surprises in the afternoon, just a continuous hike up carrying a lot of water. I made camp around 6pm and tomorrow I should arrive in town!</desc>
