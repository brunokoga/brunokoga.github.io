    <desc>Day 45
10.2 mile on Bishop Pass Trail
PCT Miles: 0
Total Miles: 832.2 (1331.5km)

I cannot believe it: I‚Äôm in town!!!

I knew that Tangent, Bullfrog and Geezer usually
start hiking early and I wanted to make sure that I wouldn‚Äôt miss the early start. I woke up around 4:30 but everybody was in a chill vibe, given that the day ahead would apparently be easy. We left camp around 6am.

The first 3 hours in the morning were all uphill as we summited to the pass. To go up, we didn‚Äôt need traction (spikes or crampons) nor an ice axe. It was the easiest pass so far. On the way down I put my crampons to feel safer. Almost the entire trail going down was under (melting) snow so it was an intense exercise on the legs. I lost contact with my group during the descent and I since I was 99% sure that I would make it to the trailhead, I took my time to hike down.

When I arrived to the trailhead, I didn‚Äôt see any of my 3 companions: either they were already gone (meaning they got a hitch to town) or I accidentally passed them on trail without noticing (possible, since it was so much snow that it becomes a ‚Äúmake your own path‚Äù situation). In any case, I had to find a ride to town (17 miles). The main problem is that I was not in a street or highway. I was in the trailhead parking lot, meaning that my chances to get a ride were very limited.

On my third attempt to ask for a ride, I went to these three ladies who had just left the trail. It was around 1pm, so I assumed they went for a morning hike. When I asked them if they could by any chance give me a ride to Bishop, one of them promptly replied: of course! Let‚Äôs go!

It was an delightful ride talking about the PCT, hiking season, Bishop and what not. Thank you so much Sports Girl and Angie for the ride! They literally left me at the front door of the hostel (which was full, so I ended up in an inn called Vagabond Inn for tonight.

First thing in town? Pizza! Second thing? Shower!

I used the rest of the afternoon to go to the gear shop to buy some things I need: flip flops (no more walking barefoot or with wet shoes at the end of the hiking days), carabiners to better attach things to my backpack and food. I also went to the supermarket to buy more food. I noticed that the amount of food that I was eating in the desert isn‚Äôt being enough for the Sierra: I need to eat more. So this time I‚Äôm making sure that I pack more food. I think my limit with the bear canister is to bring food for 6 days.

I will take at least one zero here in Bishop (maybe two). Even though I don‚Äôt have any blister or serious injury, these part days were TOUGH. My legs are exhausted and they need rest (specially my right knee). I‚Äôm very happy that I‚Äôm not hiking tomorrow. This is the first reason I came to Bishop.

The second reason, is that I completely ran out of food. When I arrived at the trailhead, I had literally zero food left. I thought I could do 180 miles with the food I brought from Kennedy Meadows 8 days ago. The food lasted one day less than I thought (thank you Carson and Handstand for giving me extra food on trail!) and only made around 140 miles, 25% less than I planned. If in the desert I was doing at least
25 miles a day, in the Sierra I‚Äôm doing an average of 17 (and feeling three times more exhausted). Lesson learned!

The third reason is that I need to buy new hiking poles, since I broke one of mine. I can feel in each step that I‚Äôm hiking with one pole, specially on elevation. I‚Äôm pretty sure that that‚Äôs why my right knee is complaining.

Lastly, there‚Äôs a bridge over a river 20 miles ahead that is broken and the PCTA (the PCT Association) suggest hikers to do an alternative route to bypass that river. To do this alternative route, you have to leave the trail where I did and re-join through another trail. That‚Äôs what I plan to do. There are people trying to cross the river without the bridge. Some of them are succeeding and some do them are being swept away. I‚Äôm completely fine not trying it üòä.</desc>
