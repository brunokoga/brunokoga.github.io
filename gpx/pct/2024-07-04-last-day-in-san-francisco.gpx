    <name>Last day in San Francisco</name>
    <desc>Day 79
PCT Miles: 0
Total Miles: 1154.5 (1847.2km)

We wanted to do something very American on Independence Day but the 40Â°C day made us decide to stay home and enjoy some air conditioning. In fact, Chris and Jessica invited a few Brazilians (including children and dogs ðŸ¥°) for lunch and we made lasagnas for everybody!

For my surprise, some of the guests were former colleagues of mine back in Brazil and it was really cool to see and chat with them after so many years.

I donâ€™t remember the last time I ate so much. During the day I had probably 5 liters of beer, lasagna, brownies, tiramisu, Melona ice cream and all the snacks that I could find. This week Iâ€™ve been doing a very good job at fattening up (I lost 8 kilos since I started the PCT and I really needed to gain some of the weight back).

(Un)fortunately I completely forgot to take pictures. I see that as a good sign ðŸ˜Š. I had a lot of fun today!

(It was so hot today that the thermostat couldnâ€™t keep up and it was complaining that it had been trying to cool down the house for a few hours and the temperature was only going up ðŸ¥µ)</desc>
