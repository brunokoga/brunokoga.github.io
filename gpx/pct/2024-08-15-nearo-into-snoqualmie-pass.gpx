    <name>Nearo into Snoqualmie Pass</name>
    <desc>Day 120
Mile 2390.4 to Snoqualmie Pass
PCT Miles: 5.4 (8.6km)
Total Miles: 2395.8 (3833.3km)

It was a double chill morning: it was really cold and the only time pressure I had was that the earlier I hiked the remaining 5.4 miles to ‚Äútown‚Äù, the earlier I would have warm breakfast and hot coffee! 

Arrived at the coffee shop around 9am and stayed until noon with Jesse, Lily and Ranger (we all camped together last night). I got my resupply box at the gas station and sorted my food for the next days. 

From there I went to my accommodation: a chalet/lodge called Washington Alpine Club. They offer a good deal for hikers which includes dinner and breakfast, clean towels and loaner clothes (clothes to use while yours are being washed). Every guest has also to pick up a chore. Mine was to take the trash out.

I had the immense surprise of meeting Geezer one more time here at the WAC! I hadn‚Äôt seen him since I took the wrong trail in the Sierras, on day 50! We had pizza for lunch together and chatted about the past days! I really miss hiking with Geezer, Bullfrog and Tangent! The group that we kindly named the Harry Pottheads ü™Ñ!

For dinner we had infinite spaghetti üçù and various salads ü•ó. Some of the vegetables were
even grown at the property itself!

For the coming days, I‚Äôm going to slow down a little bit and I decided to bring a book. I found two books here that I could read and decided to bring The Adventures of Tom Sawyer with me. It‚Äôs the first time on the PCT that I‚Äôm carrying a book üìï!</desc>
