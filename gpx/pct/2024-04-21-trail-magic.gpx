PCT Miles: 14.6 (23.4km)
Total Miles: 101.2 (161.9km)

It was my warmest night in the PCT so far. I tried to use my sleeping bag only as a blanket, but it was still too warm. I could feel the old salt in my body mixing with new sweat. Not the best night of sleep, but that ended up being good: I enjoyed the night sky in the desert, with almost full moon. The moon so bright, no clouds and a sky full of stars ✨! 

After I woke up I had to make a decision: I only had one last meal and 15 miles ahead of me. I could eat now or save it for later. I decided to eat it before hiking, so at 5:30 I was eating pasta with chili for breakfast 😋!

The sunrise in the desert is absolutely beautiful 🌄!

Soon after I started hiking, Bloopu started to complain and I noticed that I was limping. Not a very good sign. After 6 miles, a very welcomed trail magic: water cache. I gulped down 1 liter and stocked up 2 more. I had now 2.5 liter for the remaining stretch of 10 miles. 28 degrees and no shade. No food. Limping.

Maybe the water was miraculous, because as soon as I left the water cache Bloopu got better. I could hike on a good pace and the more I hiked the more I drank, the lighter my backpack became. For the last 2 miles, I was carrying no water and no food. I felt like I was flying.

I crossed the 100 mile mark (4% of the PCT 🥲) and soon after I found myself in a parking lot. I knew that there’s a mini market 4 miles off trail, but you can call for a ride. I did and 10 minutes later Mike came to pick me and another hiker up. Brought us to the Ranchita Bodega!

I will resupply here for the coming 4-5 days. It’s going to be a challenge: hike with so much added weight.

I decided to stay in a room here for tonight. That means that I had my first shower! It’s amazing how many layers of dirt your body can accumulate.

I’ve just done groceries and washed my clothes (that’s why i’m wearing my rain pants) and I’m chilling on a hammock listening to Red Hot Chili Peppers playing at the shop. Life could be worse ✌️!</desc>
