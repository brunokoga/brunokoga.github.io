I woke up first with an intense flash. If I wasn’t already awake, the massive thunder that came a few seconds later would certainly do the job.

Even though I was a bit scared in the beginning, I soon fell asleep again. The thunderstorm lasted for about two hours, but it rained the whole night until morning. I had to break out camp (and dig a cat hole) under rain.

My tent and some of my stuff were wet, but nothing extreme. Truth be told, everything held up well and I was very warm and dry during the night. During the day the sun showed up for a little bit, more than enough time for me to hang my tent to dry.

Washington is beautiful and even with the fog and rain I’ve been enjoying a lot to hike here. Once more: it’s super cool to see how many people come to hike and camp over the weekends (it’s Sunday). I saw a lot of day hikers and weekenders today.</desc>
