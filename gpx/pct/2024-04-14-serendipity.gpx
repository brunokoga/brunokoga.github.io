    <desc>I remember the exact date, the exact moment that I heard about the PCT for the first time.

It was my second winter living in Amsterdam, morning of January 27th 2017. At that time I was already planning my first long hike ever (Camino de Santiago) that was set to start in exact three months, but I had no idea that hiking would become one of my biggest passions in life. 

Three years earlier (2014) when I still lived in Brazil, I met one of my best friends, Gabriela. During one of our first random conversations she asked me if I had heard about Creative Mornings. No, never, I said. She explained  to me what it was about and I decided to give it a try and went to a few events in SÃ£o Paulo. Later, after moving to Amsterdam, I attended a few more (they organize events all around the world).

It was In one of these events (the fifth that I attended in Amsterdam) that Tim Voors, the speaker (that I had never heard about) of that event talked about the PCT (this crazy hike that I also had never heard about). I didnâ€™t even know that this would be the subject of the talk when I subscribed to the event. As always, I wanted to attend because I enjoyed the vibe and the overall inspiration that the creative community brings together. At that time, I had no idea that all these things that I didnâ€™t know combined were about to change my life forever.

I love these coincidences. I love these bits of inspiration that you can get because people decided to share their passions and their adventures with other â€” sometimes random â€” people. I love to find things that I didnâ€™t know that I was looking for.

Thank you Gabriela for introducing me to Creative Mornings. Thank you Tim for sharing your story and inspiring random people like me (even though you donâ€™t know me and youâ€™re most likely not reading this ðŸ˜…)

And thank you all for following this journey along with me. I hope I can also inspire some of you ðŸ’œ</desc>
