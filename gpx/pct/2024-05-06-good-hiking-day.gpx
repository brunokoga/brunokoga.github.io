    <name>Good hiking day ü•æüëç</name>
    <desc>Day 19
Mile 310.5 to mile 332.3
PCT Miles: 21.8 (34.9km)
Total Miles: 332.3 (531.7km)

It was quite windy during the night and apparently it rained, because my tent and part of my backpack were wet in the morning. I didn‚Äôt see a thing, I slept like a baby.

The morning was beautiful and the hike was quite pleasant during the whole day. I had to do two river crossings, one barefoot and another with my shoes which made me hike with wet feet for half of the day. There wasn‚Äôt much elevation again and the landscape was pretty beautiful, specially in the afternoon, when the PCT went around a big lake.

The weather was quite good for most part of the day, except when all of a sudden some dark
clouds showed up. But in the end it was just some cold wind and after a while the sun appeared again.

I noticed that I‚Äôve been eating much more than two weeks ago. I dare to say that I‚Äôm currently eating twice what I was eating before. This is a problem because of costs and weight carried. But we‚Äôll think about this later. Tomorrow we feast! (tomorrow I‚Äôll pass by a famous landmark of the PCT: the McDonalds at Cajon Pass)</desc>
