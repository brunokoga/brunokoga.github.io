    <name>Harder days, less miles</name>
    <desc>Day 42
Mile 790.1 to mile 805.3
PCT Miles: 15.2 (24.3km)
Total Miles: 805.3 (1288.5km)

The hiking days in the Sierra Nevada have a structure: you go over a pass as early as possible (because of the snow conditions, frozen = better), then go as close as you can to the next pass. That‚Äôs it.

The terrain is also much more complicated. It‚Äôs mostly snow, but it can be hard snow, soft snow, slushy snow. There are a lot of parts on the trail that are only rocks, and that‚Äôs super hard on ankles and knees. And it‚Äôs a lot of elevation.

For the past days I‚Äôve been learning about hiking in conditions completely new to me. I‚Äôm also trying to enjoy my time here more (it‚Äôs truly beautiful) and to be chill with the fact that I‚Äôm doing less miles. That‚Äôs perfectly fine.

For a few reasons I decided today that I‚Äôm going for my plan B: in three or four days I‚Äôll take the Bishop Pass to exit the Sierra to resupply. It‚Äôs all good, everything is fine! I‚Äôll explain the reasons when I get to Bishop.

Well, today I woke up, wore frozen shoes and started my day early, heading to Glen Pass, my second pass in the Sierra. Everything was fine and for my surprise I saw two other hikes when I reached the top of the pass! It had been a while since I saw other human beings.

I briefly talked to them (Tangent and Bullfrog), but they were hiking too fast for me. So I kept going on my own pace. The way down from Glen Pass was a bit harsh in the knees and my right knee started complaining a bit. It doesn‚Äôt help much that I‚Äôve been hiking with only one pole (that‚Äôs one reason that I‚Äôm going to Bishop)

A little before lunch I met another hiker, Fizz, who was still camped. He said that he was taking the day easy, because yesterday was too much for him. When I stopped for lunch, he showed up a few minutes later and we had lunch together. 

While we were having lunch, a couple showed up. I talked to them and explained a bit that I was going to Bishop because I really need to resupply and I‚Äôm actually running low on food (that‚Äôs another reason that I need to go to Bishop). 

They (Carson and Handstand) told me that they were not doing the PCT, but a different trail. They had planned to hike for a few days, but they were bailing out because of the amount of snow on their trail. ‚ÄúDo you want our food?‚Äù, they asked. Oh yeah!

In the end I got just food for one more day. Now I‚Äôm much more confident that I will make to Bishop and resupply. Good üëç!

After lunch I kept hiking (to as close as I can from the next pass, Pinchot Pass) and most of the trail was snow free, but it was very, very wet. Multiple stream crossings and wet feet for the whole afternoon. And that also means frozen shoes and socks tomorrow morning ü•∂.

About one hour before I finished the day, I saw Fizz hiking a bit behind me. We hiked the rest of the day together and, in the end, we‚Äôre camping side by side tonight: there‚Äôs absolutely no other snow-free space nearby.</desc>
