    <desc>Day 58
Mile 981.0 to mile 1005.6
PCT Miles: 24.6 (39.4km)
Total Miles: 1005.6 (1609.0km)

Every morning I have to pack my backpack from scratch: since the sleeping bag and sleeping mattress go on the bottom of the backpack, I need to empty it and reassemble all the contents.

Since day one I use a big dry sack where I put the sleeping stuff, my clothes (extra socks, sleeping merino pants, fleece, puffy jacket) and my power bank. Every morning I make sure that everything fits in the dry sack properly and that the dry sack is properly closed. After 58 days hiking, today was the first day that I was very thankful for my own discipline. Iâ€™ll get there soon (spoiler alert: it rained).

It was not so cold, so I slept with one of the doors of the tent open (but with the net, of course). Itâ€™s so cool to wake up at night, open your eyes and see the most starry sky ðŸŒŒ! Thatâ€™s for sure one of my favorite things about camping!

I had an ambitious plan for today: make it through the loooong ascend to Dorothy Lake Pass (and leave Yosemite) and go down to get as close as possible to Sonora Pass, where I can go to town, hopefully tomorrow. This would be awesome because I would arrive in town one day earlier than I planned and could take a nice (and well deserved!) zero. But that also meant a 24 miles day.

The day started well. The deer family was still around in the morning and I was in good mood so I started the day hiking a bit faster, trying to push a bit on the ascend to Dorothy Lake Pass. It was very wet and swampy and my feet stayed wet for the whole day. Itâ€™s actually kind of liberating when you realize that thereâ€™s no other way, so you should just accept that you can freely step in water or mud.

Mosquitoes surrounded me at all times. In the morning I had to hike with rain pants, wind jacket and the head net. It was suffocating to hike on my own portable sauna, but itâ€™s just maddening otherwise. For three times I tried to take a break but itâ€™s just impossible to enjoy, so I kept hiking without a break for 14 miles. I could only stop to have breakfast+lunch at 1pm, having started at 6. I was starving.

Good thing is that it made a very productive morning, although I still needed to hike up three more miles to go over the pass and descend for seven miles to the campsite.

At 3pm I made it to the top. There was very little snow (but a lot of water). By the way, I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll need my snow gear anymore. Iâ€™ll probably mail them back next week.

Crossing the pass, I was in a tight but possible schedule. I was hoping for little snow on the other side as well. What I was not really expecting was rain. And hail.

I still had to hike for 7 miles, which usually takes me 3-4 hours, depending on the trail. As soon as it started raining I wore my rain jacket (for the first time!) and exhaled relieved as I remembered that my things were protected from the rain in my backpack. A few minutes after the rain, it started to hail. The mix of rain and hail lasted for about one hour. For the first mile or so (~30 min), there was a bit of snow, but then the trail became snow-free. I was a bit scared when it started raining but I checked the forecast and the sky should clear up tonight still. I just wanted to arrive at camp,
so I hiked fast. In the end, the rain didnâ€™t bother me that much.

I arrived at camp before 6pm (!), so I had plenty of time. Unfortunately the rain became a bit heavier while I was setting up my tent and everything got wet inside. Right after it stopped raining I opened the doors and let the air circulate to dry the tent a bit and since all my sleeping stuff are super dry, itâ€™s all good!

Currently itâ€™s not possible to enjoy the camp. Itâ€™s unbelievable the amount of mosquitoes and how theyâ€™re really hungry! Since yesterday, the first thing to do when arriving at camp is to wear the anti-mosquito clothes (pants, jacket, net). Only then you can proceed with the other chores.

Tomorrow I have a relatively short day (12.5 miles) to arrive in town! The two problems are: first, itâ€™s a big ascend (~2300ft/700m) up to almost 11000ft/3350m. Hopefully there wonâ€™t be a lot of snow to slow me down. Second, all my things are wet. Iâ€™m not sure how early Iâ€™ll be able to leave camp in the morning. Letâ€™s see!</desc>
