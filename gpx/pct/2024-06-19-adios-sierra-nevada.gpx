    <desc>Day 63
Mile 1054.4 to mile 1074.4
PCT Miles: 20.0 (32.0km)
Total Miles: 1074.4 (1719.0km)

I slept for 8-9 hours peacefully. I woke up super warm and I was surprised when I saw that it was -6¬∞C! Apparently wearing all my clothes can really keep me warm.

When I left my tent I saw that Bullfrog had re-started the fire. He was boiling water for his every morning tea. He‚Äôs English.

Usually I don‚Äôt eat breakfast when I wake up. I prefer to have it after a few hours hiking. But a campfire is for sure a good reason to have break this rule, so after I packed up I joined Bullfrog for half an hour or so and had my chocolate electronola. I started hiking around 6:30 and Bullfrog stayed, enjoying the fire.

The day was chilly but less windy. I don‚Äôt know if I already told this, but I‚Äôm hiking wearing my fleece because my sun hoodie (hiking shirt) was so full of holes that I had to throw it away. In the end it‚Äôs been very convenient because the past three days have been quite cold.

I knew from the beginning that today I would do 20 miles (and 19 tomorrow), so I took my time and hiked at a chill pace. Twenty miles shouldn‚Äôt be that difficult. And it wasn‚Äôt. The day passed by and I had a very pleasant hiking day.

One thing they have been missing (thank god) for a few days already are the mosquitoes. I really really really hope it stays like that.

I arrived at camp before 4pm and had time to chill and do everything slowly, which is always good. Bullfrog just arrived (it‚Äôs 6:15pm now). Tomorrow I should have no problems getting to Echo Lake (19 miles) and from there hitching to South Lake Tahoe! Can‚Äôt wait to have a pizza in town üçïüòã!</desc>
