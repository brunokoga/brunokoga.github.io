    <desc>Day 90
Mile 1370.8 to mile 1385.8
PCT Miles: 15.0 (24.0km)
Total Miles: 1385.8 (2217.3km)

Nothing like a swim in the river and ‚Äúclean‚Äù clothes to make you sleep well. Yesterday I was ready to sleep at 7pm but I forced myself to stay awake until 8. Then I slept like a stone until 5:30.

I arrived in Old Station at 7:30 and found exactly what I was looking for: a power outlet and internet connection! Now I had what to do until the general store opened (at 9). The post office opens at 11.

There was only one cliff bar left of all my food. I was starving (and very happy that my food lasted exactly what it needed to last). I was the first customer at the general store (and at the post office too). For breakfast I had two frozen burritos (microwaved at the store), two ice cream sandwiches, a big cup of coffee and a six pack of beer. I love this day already!

When the post office opened and I asked for
my package, Ren√©e, the awesome clerk who works there, told me that she was wondering whose this package was, because it was so colorful. Artwork from Maike and Jessica üíú!

I was very happy that my box was there. Now, I have food for 8-9 days again! My initial plan was to go to Etna (225 miles away), but the town is under evacuation because of a wildfire. 

After mile 1600 there‚Äôs a part of the PCT that is closed (and will mos likely be closed for the entire year since the Shelly fire literally crosses the PCT). I still need to figure out what I‚Äôm going to do, but I‚Äôll do that later. At least for the coming five days I‚Äôm far away from the fire, so I don‚Äôt need to decide now.

In any case, today I sent my inflatable sleeping mattress and my extra clothes to Ashland, Oregon. I haven‚Äôt been using them since last week and with this heat I doubt I will. Now I sleep using the sleeping pad only and my only extra clothes are 1 pair of socks and 1 puff jacket!

I liked the idea of mailing myself a resupply
box so much that I‚Äôm brewing a plan in my mind to mail myself all the remaining food for the PCT once I‚Äôm in Ashland in around 10 days. Let me think more about this and I‚Äôll share here soon!</desc>
