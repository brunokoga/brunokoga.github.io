At that time I was already planning my first long hike ever (Camino de Santiago) that was set to start in exact three months, but I had no idea that hiking would become one of my biggest passions in life. \n\nThree years earlier (2014) when I still lived in Brazil, I met one of my best friends, Gabriela. During one of our first random conversations she asked me if I had heard about Creative Mornings. No, never, I said. She explained  to me what it was about and I decided to give it a try and went to a few events in S\u00e3o Paulo. Later, after moving to Amsterdam, I attended a few more (they organize events all around the world).\n\nIt was In one of these events (the fifth that I attended in Amsterdam) that Tim Voors, the speaker (that I had never heard about) of that event talked about the PCT (this crazy hike that I also had never heard about). I didn\u2019t even know that this would be the subject of the talk when I subscribed to the event. As always, I wanted to attend because I enjoyed the vibe and the overall inspiration that the creative community brings together. At that time, I had no idea that all these things that I didn\u2019t know combined were about to change my life forever.\n\nI love these coincidences. I love these bits of inspiration that you can get because people decided to share their passions and their adventures with other \u2014 sometimes random \u2014 people. I love to find things that I didn\u2019t know that I was looking for.\n\nThank you Gabriela for introducing me to Creative Mornings. Thank you Tim for sharing your story and inspiring random people like me (even though you don\u2019t know me and you\u2019re most likely not reading this \ud83d\ude05)\n\nAnd thank you all for following this journey along with me.

The book, written by Barney \u201cScout\u201d Mann, tells his story about thru hiking the PCT in 2007 together with his wife, Frodo. \n\nSince then, every spring they open their home in San Diego to host hikers from all over the world before they start their own PCT. I\u2019m fortunate enough to be staying with them for the coming two nights.\n\nAfter more than 12 hours flying (plus passport control, plus train, plus 40 minutes walking) I arrived at their house. As soon as I rang the bell, Rolling Thunder came to welcome me with the biggest smile. Right after him, I see Scout as he says \u201cWelcome, Bruno. I\u2019m glad to have you here\u201d. A third person hands me a warm and fresh plate of food. I was completely (and positively) overwhelmed. \n\nAround 25 hikers stay here every night during the hiking season. Scout and Frodo (with the help from other fantastic volunteers) cook dinner and breakfast for us every single day. They also receive packages, organize trips to the sports store and supermarket and give us tips and motivation to the adventure that\u2019s about to start. After dinner Scout told us beautiful (and sad) stories about the PCT and urge us to be kind along the way. Frodo gave us the best advice possible: make wise decisions.\n\nThey don\u2019t accept any kind of gift or donation (other than words). They say they\u2019re fortunate enough to be able to do that and, in exchange, they ask us to be nice to each other and with the trail. They ask us to help any other hiker in need. They also remember us not to be afraid to ask for help when we need. And they make it very clear that, at some point during the PCT, everyone will need help.\n\nRight now, I feel like I\u2019m the luckiest person in the world.

We were blessed with a beautiful, beautiful sunrise!\n\nAfter that we went back to Cleef to have breakfast. What a magical place!

I woke up around 5 and right before 6 I was already hiking. Not much because I wanted to, but because I needed to beat the heat. Besides the forecast of 30 degrees and almost no shade, this section doesn\u2019t have many water sources.\n\nI hiked mostly alone (yay!) and did another 10 before 10, properly celebrated with my first snake sighting! It was not a rattle snake though, just a normal scary terrifying long random snake \ud83d\udc0d.\n\nI kept pushing until Scissors Crossing, where most hikers hitch to Julian, a hiker\u2019s town. I didn\u2019t want to go to Julian, but I was out of water. Then, I experienced my first trail magic: right under a bridge (one of the few places with a shade today) there was a water cache! It\u2019s a known cache, replenished every day (multiple times a day) by trail angels. While I was there having my lunch and resting (it was a pretty tough and warm morning), I saw someone coming with more water, tangerines, bananas and cold gatorades and leaving everything there for the hikers. I find it truly amazing and inspiring that people do that!\n\nAfter a good two hours break it was time for the toughest part for me so far: the next water cache should be 14 miles ahead, which basically meant that I had to dry camp tonight: camping without a water source nearby. I started my afternoon carrying 5 liters of water, which almost doubles the weight of my backpack. For the next 10 miles I had absolutely no shade and I sweated like a madman. I can see stains of salt everywhere on my clothes. My face literally has a white layer on top \ud83e\uddc2!\n\nI\u2019m eating my dinner as I write this and now there\u2019s only one meal left on my backpack!

I tried to use my sleeping bag only as a blanket, but it was still too warm. I could feel the old salt in my body mixing with new sweat. Not the best night of sleep, but that ended up being good: I enjoyed the night sky in the desert, with almost full moon. The moon so bright, no clouds and a sky full of stars \u2728! \n\nAfter I woke up I had to make a decision: I only had one last meal and 15 miles ahead of me. I could eat now or save it for later. I decided to eat it before hiking, so at 5:30 I was eating pasta with chili for breakfast \ud83d\ude0b!\n\nThe sunrise in the desert is absolutely beautiful \ud83c\udf04!\n\nSoon after I started hiking, Bloopu started to complain and I noticed that I was limping. Not a very good sign. After 6 miles, a very welcomed trail magic: water cache. I gulped down 1 liter and stocked up 2 more. I had now 2.5 liter for the remaining stretch of 10 miles. 28 degrees and no shade. No food. Limping.\n\nMaybe the water was miraculous, because as soon as I left the water cache Bloopu got better. I could hike on a good pace and the more I hiked the more I drank, the lighter my backpack became. For the last 2 miles, I was carrying no water and no food. I felt like I was flying.\n\nI crossed the 100 mile mark (4% of the PCT \ud83e\udd72) and soon after I found myself in a parking lot. I knew that there\u2019s a mini market 4 miles off trail, but you can call for a ride. I did and 10 minutes later Mike came to pick me and another hiker up. Brought us to the Ranchita Bodega!\n\nI will resupply here for the coming 4-5 days. It\u2019s going to be a challenge: hike with so much added weight.\n\nI decided to stay in a room here for tonight.

I learned this before going to my first Camino de Santiago in 2017 but I very rarely have blisters (knock on wood \ud83e\udd1c\ud83d\udca5\ud83e\udeb5 ) and never needed to do it. \n\nAfter sterilizing the needle with fire and alcohol, I popped Bloopu and the blood started to leak through the thread.

Mike would drive me back to the trailhead at 9, so I could chill until then. I called Maike \ud83d\udc9c and used the last chance to top up the batteries of all the electronic stuff. I decided to bring just enough water until the next water source (my backpack is super heavy with the food).\n\nA bit before 9 Mike showed up and brought me and two more hikers to the trailhead. Selfie time!\n\nMy little toe was feeling great and I walked on quite a good pace for about 4 hours. At some point, there were some very curious cows on a mud path. It was all a bit wet with some puddles here and there. I tried to jump over one of the puddles... I slipped and ended up falling on my back on the ground. Everything\u2019s fine, nobody\u2019s hurt but my whole back and my backpack were now covered by a mix of mud and cow\u2019s juice. I hiked 3 miles smelling like cow and completely dirty.\n\nAfter one and a half hour having to deal with\nmyself covered in that dark brown blerbh, there was a creek and I could wash everything. I wore everything back wet, which was actually quite refreshing. In less than an hour everything was dry again \ud83e\udd75.\n\nThe path today was much more beautiful and less exposed than the previous days. There was a lot of oak trees providing shade and the ground was much softer. There were also some parts of desert \ud83c\udf35 of course. \n\nEven though I was pretty pissed with the cow\u2019s juice situation, my overall mood was very good today. There will be a stretch of 12 miles without water and I\u2019ll have to dry camp tonight. That means that at some point I was carrying my full capacity of water: 5.5 liters. This is the heaviest my backpack has ever been! \n\nEven though the last miles of the day were uphill, everything was fine.

And still alive!! \ud83e\udd73\n\nEven though the night had been quite warm, I woke up a bit cold. As soon as I opened my tent, I realized why! Everything was very humid as I was in the middle of a dense mist. I tried to pack as soon as I could but the beauty of my surroundings made me a bit catatonic. I left camp at 6:40.\n\nThe morning was gorgeous! That was the most beautiful day I had in the PCT so far. For hours I could see from above the fog trapped in the valley. As the sun slowly showed up, the views of the top of the mountains over the fog were unbelievably beautiful. \n\nNot only the most beautiful day, but today was also the day where I had to carry 7.5 liters of water! I didn\u2019t want to trust one of the water sources (a cistern that was rated as \u201cdry and full of dead animals\u201d), so my alternative was to hike 24 miles plus dry camping in one go. But for that, one of the other water sources, called Mike\u2019s Place and maintained upon donations, had to be working. My morning was divided between hiking, admiring the surroundings and praying for water.\n\nAt mile 127, I saw a sign that I was hoping for: the directions to Mike\u2019s Place. A few more minutes walking off trail and I could see the big water tank. And it had water. Maravilha!\n\nTime to camel up (drink water at a source until you can\u2019t anymore) and fill every single bottle I had. Total 7.5 liters and a backpack that I almost couldn\u2019t lift. I think it weighted something around 17-18 kilos\u2026 \ud83e\udd75\n\nSlowly but steadily I kept hiking and very consciously drinking water. In a way I had to save water to be sure I\u2019d  have water for 24 miles plus dry camping, but I also wanted to get rid of the weight as soon as I could.\n\nI\u2019m so happy that Bloopu is gone. My left foot is much much better. I\u2019m not sure I could have carried so much weight if Bloopu was there. Unfortunately it seems that some relative of Bloopu is starting to show up on my right little toe. I\u2019m sure you all are very interested in this topic so I will keep you posted!\n\nAround 5pm and after 21 miles I decided to make camp. Maybe I didn\u2019t choose the best place because it\u2019s super windy, but there\u2019s absolutely no chance that I walk another single mile today. I\u2019m glad that I have a proper tent and not only a tarp like some people hiking the PCT.\n\nTomorrow there\u2019s a famous Caf\u00e9 that\u2019s accessible hiking a bit off trail and I\u2019m hoping to eat real food.

And it was windy for the whole day.\n\nThere are very few water sources in this part of the trail. I was excited to go to Paradise Valley Caf\u00e9, 1 mile off trail, so I could refill my water (and eat a vegetarian burger just in case). Also, I needed to go to get my micro spikes that I ordered last Sunday. Depending on a lot of factors, sometimes you need micro spikes (and an ice axe \ud83e\ude93) for this part of the trail and sometimes not. Because I\u2019m still trying my best not to die, I decided to carry micro spikes from today on.\n\nIt was a very efficient morning (10 before 10!) and Paradise Valley Caf\u00e9 (PVC) didn\u2019t disappoint: I had a nice beer, at least four cups of ice cold water, burger and fries. I also found my package \ud83d\udce6 amongst hundreds of others and refilled my water until the next water source.\n\nI had to quickly go back to trail because I still had more than 12 miles ahead of me and today I was not carrying enough water to dry camp, so I had to make it to my next water source: a spring (Cedar Sprint) 1 mile off trail. Everything seemed fine.\n\nUntil the storm started to approach.\n\nAfter leaving PVC I was hiking slow because I was heavy with all the water and the elevation went from 4 to 7 thousand feet \ud83e\uddb6 (whatever that is in meters). But the more I hiked the more I felt that I was hiking straight into the stormy clouds that were gathering. At some point the sun was hidden and the wind was blowing violently and it started to become chilly. I still had at least 3 hours to hike. I was so concerned about the storm that my first sight of a rattlesnake didn\u2019t bother me much (and it was very close). I had only one goal: arrive at the spring before it started raining or getting too dark.\n\nAfter rushing a bit and feeling the wind pushing me to the side for the last hour or so, I arrived around 18 and gladly there was enough space close to the spring for my tent. I\u2019m happy that I could camp here, it seems more protected from the wind. The wind is so strong that it sounds like ocean waves crashing into rocks. \n\nHopefully tomorrow the wind won\u2019t be as strong, specially during the day. I still need to ascend 2000 feet and hike 16 miles with all the water for the day. My plan is to finish the day hiking off trail (through another trail called Devil\u2019s Slide \ud83d\udc7f\ud83d\udedd) into Idyllwild, my next resupply stop!\n\n(today I hiked 3 miles off trail: 2 miles to and from\nPVC plus 1 mile to Cedar Spring.

Oh boy if only I knew\u2026\n\nI decided to have a coffee and a tea to warm me up before I left camp. One of the obvious advantages of camping close to a spring is that you have unlimited water. I wanted to wait for the wind to become less intense and for the cold and condensation on my tent to dissipate a bit.\n\nWearing for the first time my fleece and my gloves \ud83e\udde4 I left camp at 8. 1 mile hiking up back to trail \ud83e\udd2c and then off I went to\u2026 the middle of the storm.\n\nTo be fair, it didn\u2019t rain (or snow or hail) but the wind was so strong and so cold that at some times I had to stop hiking just to keep my balance. Today I was not hiding under the trees for shade. I was hiding behind rocks or bushes for wind protection.\n\nNot only it was a steep climb of more than 2000 feet to a maximum elevation on 8800 feet in was also not carrying so much water. I was hoping not to drink too much since it was not so warm. The problem is that the ascent took much more than I thought. It was super steep (and windy!!). Not only the physical effort was huge, I tried my best to keep it slow to prevent altitude sickness.\n\nThere were trees and branches and rocks spread all over the path. To be honest it really made the hike more fun (jump over or crawl under a tree, finding ways of going around impenetrable blobs of branches, etc) but it also made it so much slow. I was hiking under 1.5 mile an hour and that was simply not going to work.\n\nAround lunchtime I passed this group of 4 people. As I usually do, I quickly stop to introduce myself, wish them a good day and carry on with my bike. Hi, I\u2019m Bruno, I said. Toni, Noelle, Tenor and Virginia they replied! Have I nice day, I wished to them. You too, they replied. Oh by the way there\u2019s something on in your fanny pack, Toni yelled. I noticed that\nmy headlamp was on for some reason. The light was very faint, so it probably was on for the whole\nmorning (and past evening?). I turned it off and yelled back: thank you!\n\nAt mile 169, I saw what I was absolutely not looking forward: snow and ice on the path. The first test was actually a steep cliff edge. Remembering the first rule (don\u2019t die!) I decided to put my micro spikes on. But before, time to read the manual as I had no idea what I was doing\u2026 It turned out to be pretty straightforward and there I was, all micro spiked and ready for some ice and snow action!\n\nEverything went fine. There was not thaaat amount\nof snow and I felt safe all the time. It was just impossible to look down at the cliffs. Every step in inclined snow took me forever, which I don\u2019t regret.\n\nEven the sun decided to show up (after I was above the clouds). It was still very cold and windy but sunny. Maybe too sunny. I started drinking much more water and I was so relieved when I found a spring from melted snow running alongside a rock wall. Time to refill!\n\nBecause it took me so long to hike today, I decided not to go to Idylllwild and instead camp on top of the mountain. I heard that the descend to Idyllwild was a bit steep and there was a considerable amount of ice and snow. Better to do it tomorrow morning when my body is rested.\n\nI couldn\u2019t wait to make camp. I didn\u2019t have more lunch food and I ate all my snacks during the day. The only thing left was a knorr spaghetti and a couscous, both I had to cook. I was really looking forward to a warm meal!\n\nAt 5 I finally found the last place to camp before the descend to Idyllwild. It was a beautiful place with a beautiful view to both sides of the mountain. I was alone and there was not much protection from the wind though, so I pitched my tent with some struggle. I used big rocks to secure my tent stakes in place. Everything good, time for some well deserved rest and warm food!\n\nWhat a crazy day! While I was pitching my tent I thought that this was probably the most adventurous and challenging hike day I\u2019ve ever had. So exhausting but so rewarding!\n\nIt indeed ended up being the most adventurous day of my life.

I hear something break and the metallic sound makes me sure it\u2019s not just another branch.\n\nI look back and my tent pole is broken, my tent flapping and swinging with the wind as if it was a weird flag attached to the ground. It took me a few seconds (or minutes) to assess the situation. The forecast is 4 degrees (surely colder here on top of the mountain), sustained winds of 40 mph (64km/h), cold and wet feet and no tent. It seemed difficult not to break the only rule I\u2019m trying to follow here. What could I possibly do?\n\n\u201cHiiii Bruuuunoooo\u201d I hear. Holy shit, I\u2019m delirious I think. I\u2019m so exhausted that I\u2019m hearing the wind saying my name.\n\n\u201cBruno!!!\u201d I hear, but now it\u2019s a different voice. I can\u2019t believe what I\u2019m seeing.\n\nToni, Noelle, Tenor and Virginia were crossing the last patch of snow before where I am. When I met them earlier today we brielfly exchanged our plans: I was going to Idyllwild via the Devil\u2019s Slide trail and they would be camping in the last camp spot, which is where we are now. My plan obviously changed and I\u2019m so happy to see them!\n\nDude you\u2019re crazy to camp here with this storm, Tenor said. We\u2019ll push to Idyllwild, he continued.\n\nOnce more I couldn\u2019t believe what I was listening.\n\nI looked at each one of them. They also looked exhausted. How are you guys possibly going to Idyllwild still? It\u2019s going to take at least two hours and the path ahead is really full of snow, I asked. We know, but we won\u2019t be here in this storm tonight. We\u2019ll push it though, one of them said.\n\nCan I please join you guys? I need five minutes to disassemble this\u2026 tent?\n\nOf course! The four of them replied in unison.\n\nThere I was. 5:30 in the evening, exhausted and still a good 2-3 hours of hike ahead of me. Let\u2019s do this!\n\nThe evening was stunning. The sky was clear and even the wind was milder. And even though we had to hike mainly on ice and snow, it was not sketchy or dangerous at all (I guess).\n\nI was happy to be with other people that had more experience than me in these conditions. Also, whenever something would happen, like somebody sinking knee deep jnto the snow, sliding or even falling, instead of thinking \u201coh shit I\u2019m going to die\u201d there was always a \u201care you ok?\u201d checkup followed by some laughs. I didn\u2019t realize that, but I missed laughing.\n\nThe problems was that we were slow. Besides the terrain not being the friendliest and us being super tired, we were stopping more than normal to take pictures. There was a beautiful sunset and nobody wanted to miss it. Until someone realizes that at the sunset, the sun\u2026 sets! We\u2019re going to be in the darkness!\n\nWe started rushing a bit, but there was no way to espace our destiny. At some point some commanded: everybody: head lamps on! Yes, sir \ud83e\udee1! I put my head lamp on and\u2026 yeah, I remembered that it had been on probably for the whole day and past night by accident, so I have no light. I stayed in the middle of the pack and thankfully their lights were enough to show me the way.\n\nThen it was 7, 7:30, 8\u2026 and we were still in the mountain. At 8 we started our decent and at 8:30 there was \u2014 finally! \u2014 no more snow. We took off our micro spikes and started almost to run downhill. At 9:30 in the evening, after hiking in the complete darkness for more than one and a half hour, we arrived at the trailhead parking lot where a trail angel was waiting to pick us up. We couldn\u2019t believe it (at least I couldn\u2019t!). We all high fived and prepared to go to town!\n\nExcept\u2026\n\nWe were five people. The trail angel rightfully only wanted to bring 4 at a time. Because I was new\nin the group (and I was so thankful that they \u201crescued\u201d me) I decided to stay. The trail\nangel said she would be back in 20-30 minutes to pick me up. Before leaving, the trail angel said: please be safe, I\u2019ll be back for you. And be careful with mountain lions, we do have some in this region.\n\nBE CAREFUL WITH WHAT WHY DID YOU TELL\nME THIS?\n\nAnd off they went.\n\nIt was pitch dark (no head lamp!) and getting very cold, very quickly, but I had no other choice. I wore all my clothes (literally!) and waited in the dark. I could barely use my phone because I didn\u2019t want to take my hands out of my pockets. It was the longest 20 minutes of my life. I felt that I was in a movie terror. A crime scene. A mountain lion\u2019s dinning table. Every single sound in the mountains (and I was surrounded by them) caused a shiver down my spine. And I couldn\u2019t even see it. Was it a mountain lion or just a leaf falling? Who knows.\n\nFinally my trail angel arrived (omg thank you for coming back). When I said thank you so much she said it\u2019s my pleasure Bruno, I said I was coming back for you, I came back the fastest as I could.\n\nIt was 10 o\u2019clock already, one hour past hiker\u2019s midnight. I didn\u2019t have a place to sleep in town. All the inns and hotels were already closed, since usually they don\u2019t get late night unannounced guests. I went to the city\u2019s campground. I couldn\u2019t find nobody to check-in (and pay) so I just entered, found a spot and set my tent. In the end I could book a tent spot online, so at least I could sleep without possibly being woken up at 6am by the campground patrol.\n\nBefore falling in deep sleep, I cooked water and mixed everything else that I had in a single meal. My spaghetti-couscous-olive-oil-peanut-butter was absolutely delicious!\n\nEven though I was depleted, I couldn\u2019t fall asleep. My mind wanted to think about all the bad things, all the risks, all the exhaustion. I put in my mind that I wouldn\u2019t think about anything or make any plans. I put my headphones on and fell asleep almost instantly.", "slug": "idyllwild-pine-cove", "display_slug": "idyllwild-pine-cove", "type": 1, "start_time": 1714090240.781524, "end_time": null, "creation_time": 1714144398.783978, "location": {"id": 122907116, "name": "Idyllwild-Pine Cove", "detail": "USA", "full_detail": "California, USA", "country_code": "US", "lat": 33.76320887360141, "lon": -116.64717458199397, "venue": null, "uuid": "1F128615-F41E-4163-8098-38BC5A0962F5"}, "supertype": "normal", "is_deleted": false, "open_graph_id": null, "fb_publish_status": null, "timezone_id": "America/Los_Angeles", "views": 0, "comment_count": 9, "weather_condition": null, "weather_temperature": null, "uuid": "A762B8B8-44CA-4F0A-B0FA-34D9A2A0E57F"}, {"id": 99328268, "trip_id": 10158283, "location_id": 123039514, "main_media_item_path": null, "name": "Idyllwild - First Zero!", "display_name": "Idyllwild - First Zero!", "description": "Day 10\nPCT Miles: 0\nTotal Miles: 179.4 (287km)\n\nMy first Zero!

But in reality, a zero day is used to do all the city chores you can\u2019t while your in the wild.\n\nI woke up early as usual, but I was still very tired and very sleepy. My body was stiff from both the intensity of yesterday and the lack of stretching (usually I stretch before and after hiking and yesterday I skipped the latter). When I got up to use the bathroom, I realized that my socks and shoes were wet. And it was 4 degrees outside! Wet socks on, wet shoes on and here we go to start our zero day!\n\nIdyllwild is such a cute town. There are plenty of places to have breakfast (by plenty I mean like five) and I decided to have a breakfast burrito \ud83c\udf2f! Oh breakfast burrito! An old favorite of mine! I decided to go to Mama\u2019s Egg House \ud83e\udd31\ud83e\udd5a\ud83c\udfe0!\n\nAnd who do I meet there? Clara!! It was so so good to see a familiar face and catch up about the last days. She\u2019s having a good time so far and also taking a zero. She actually hitched from PVC to resupply and buy micro spikes (good idea!) and is coming back there tomorrow to continue her hike. And we had the conversation over a proper freshly brewed coffee. Life is already getting better!\n\nFrom there I came back to the campground to call Maike \ud83d\udc9c, pack and go to the Ranger\u2019s office to ask for a permit to enter and camp the San Jacinto Wilderness Area (I\u2019ll explain why when I get at Big Bear Lake at mile 266). Mary, the ranger that signed my permit was the most adorable person and so enthusiastic about her job. It\u2019s so good to be treated with so much care and attention. Thank you, Mary! You definitely made my day better!\n\nFrom there I went to the gear shop to resupply and buy some additional equipment. I upgraded my water bladder (that I I use for filtering water) and added a nice elastic chord outside my backpack so I can hang things a little bit easier. Other than that, just the usual food/gas/electrolytes/snacks shopping. And I got a whole celery stalk as a gift! \n\nFinished with that, I went to a caf\u00e9 to have another coffee and rest a bit before I could check-in into my room. There I run into Clara again, which was awesome to kill time. From there I checked in and got my room!\n\nIt seems that as soon as I entered my room, my backpack exploded everywhere! I went immediately to shower and wore my rain pants and jacket, so I could do laundry. The rest of my day was divided between laundry, cleaning my equipment (sleeping bag and tent), going to the supermarket, ordering a pizza (I ate it with a full bag of salad, I\u2019m calling this pizzalata) and repacking everything again. All of a sudden it\u2019s already 8 in the eventing and I\u2019m almost ready to sleep.

It\u2019s near zero.\n\nFor some reason I didn\u2019t sleep well. Maybe my body rejected the idea of me sleeping in a king bed on my zero. To compensate that I had raspberry ice cream and pizza for breakfast. I actually bought the ice cream because I want to use the cup as a container for musli/granola! Let\u2019s see if it works \ud83d\ude43.\n\nAfter breakfast I sent a message on the \u201cIdyllwild Trail Angels\u201d facebook group asking for a ride to the trailhead. One guy responded within one hour (thanks Leo!) saying the he would pick me up at the inn at 11 and drive me to the trailhead of Devil\u2019s Slide, so I can continue the PCT from where I left. Sweet!\n\nThe difference between packing up in a room or in the campground is that in a room you\u2019re never sure that you packed everything. In the campground, you just look back and make sure there\u2019s nothing left behind.\n\nIn the meantime, Hanne (a girl from Belgium who started hiking together on the first day with Clara, Max and Marie/Mary) texted me because she also wanted to go to Devil\u2019s Slide. That was awesome because I was not looking very forward to hike up the snow-covered trail alone. Everything worked perfectly and Leo also picked her up. I hiked most of my short day with her.\n\nAs soon as we started we met a legend from the PCT, SanJacJon. It\u2019s a guy that voluntarily climbs up the San Jacinto Peak every week to report the current status of the track. I literally watched his video (from April 18th) this morning where he reported the conditions of the Fuller Ridge, the trail that I\u2019ll hike tomorrow. As a matter of fact, I decided to hike it tomorrow and not today because of his report.\n\nSince the Devil\u2019s Slide (2.5 mile long, 1600 feet of elevation) is not part of the PCT, both the hike down two days ago and the hike up are not added to the total miles hiked \ud83e\udd72. At least this time I could actually see the path and even though there was a lot of snow, both of us didn\u2019t use the spikes. We took our time to hike steady and slowly. It was a beautiful hike, even though the fog decided to show up at some point.\n\nAfter arriving at Saddle Junction (where the PCT continued) we kept hiking slow, following the path on the snow until we reached 9000 feet of altitude. Even though I\u2019m carrying food for 7-8 days, I don\u2019t need to carry more than one liter of water at a time, since water here up in the mountains is abundant because of all the snow melting, so the weight of my backpack is ok.\n\nAround 4pm I arrived at my campsite. Hanne kept hiking for a few more miles. I pitched my tent, had an early dinner (Pad Thai) and now, 17:44, I\u2019m already ready to sleep \ud83d\ude34.\n\nPS: I had a hole on the phone pocket of my shorts.

I left camp around 7:30 prepared for my day full of snow and ice \ud83e\uddca.\n\nAfter a few miles I already had to put my spikes on and I kept them on for at least four hours. In the beginning of the day it was easy to hike on the ice, because everything was kind of refrozen from the night. But as I advanced in the day (today was very sunny, gorgeous!), the ice and snow started to melt and everything became slippery. Hiking on slippery ice is such a mental process!\n\nAnd it just takes one microsecond of distraction for something to go wrong. That was exactly what happened to me today.\n\nAt some point I had removed my spikes because the\nsnow was gone. After maybe 15-20 minutes, the snow was back on the trail and I decided to put the spikes back on (which is a tedious process because you have to find a place to sit, take off the backpack, etc). And I\u2019m so happy that I did.\n\nThe trail was full of snow but it also was fully exposed to the sun. That made all the ice and snow very slushy, very not grippy. I can\u2019t even remember how, but I stepped in a slippery part and in a fraction of a second I was sliding down a \u201cgentle\u201d slope. Gentle because it was not a cliff or anything, but it took me 5-6 seconds to be able to stop the fall. At the cost of my knuckles and one of my hiking poles. Nothing serious happened to me. Later I found out that all my three water bottles had fallen from my backpack during my own fall. What a morning! (you can watch me talking about the accident on the last video of this post.)\n\nAfter I realized what had just happened I was a bit down (and thirsty). For the rest of the morning I hiked fully focused on the path, taking very cautious step after step. Around 1pm I arrived in this nice picnic area and stopped for lunch and to tape my knuckles. After this break, the snow and ice were really gone,l so no spikes were needed anymore. In fact, it became very sunny and warm and \u201cdesertic\u201d again. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to see snow again for the next 500 miles. For the next four hours (12 miles) the path was much easier and downhill. I made camp at 6pm.\n\nFor the coming 4 days, until I\u2019m in town again, my full water capacity is only 2 liters.

In short, there\u2019s one part of the PCT (around 10 miles) that is completely gone and in order to advance you have to hike upstream on a creek. Sounds like fun!\n\nAnd it was actually fun. For the first 2-3 hours, but not the whole day.

At least carrying water was not a problem today\u2026 \n\nToday was also the first day that I had the full rattlesnake experience: being rattled at, almost having a heart attack, and then seeing the monster looking at you as if it want to eat you alive. All of that with that rattle that sounds like a death sentence. At least, with rattlesnakes the theory works: just go back, give it some space and at some point it\u2019ll go away.

Weirdly I woke up not in the best mood ever. I left camp at 6:30 and took me a few hours to really get going. The day started with more hiking up the creek\u2019s bed until finally I was on the trail for real. There were parts of tre trail that were destroyed and some bushwhacking and \u201cmake your own path\u201d were necessary. It was kind of fun. If I wouldn\u2019t be so tired from yesterday I would probably have enjoyed much much more.\n\nThe day was beautiful and because I was high in the mountains (above 8000 feet for most of the day) it was not so warm.

I think this was the first night that it was below freezing \ud83e\udd76 brrrrr. Waking up at 5:30, getting out of my warm sleeping bag and unpitching the tent when it\u2019s cold is so so difficult. The tent poles feel like ice bars in your hands. It was the first\nmorning so far that I started hiking with my puff jacket on (plus gloves and windbreaker).\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long though for the sun to come up and for me so start peeling off my layers. At 7:30 or so I was already hiking on full desert mode.\n\nThe hiking day itself was pretty short and uneventful. At 10 I was already waiting for a trail angel (Kenny) to pick me up. I needed to resupply for the coming days and my initial plan was to take a zero tomorrow in Big Bear. Kenny brought me to his place, where he hosts hikers. Such a crazy place! There was freshly made breakfast (french toast \ud83c\udf5e, eggs \ud83c\udf73 and chili potatoes \ud83c\udf36\ufe0f\ud83e\udd54! I also met some of people that I had been hiking with in the past days and some of the people that I met last night on camp. With one similarity between them all: they were all sick. And when I say sick, I mean *sick*.\n\nOne of the assumptions is that it could have been the water from the demoniac mission creek from the past days. It\u2019s weird because everybody filters the water. I for sure drank from the creek at some point (although I don\u2019t remember when or how much).\n\nThe other possibility would be a virus that\u2019s infecting everyone. I found this quite fascinating since it seems that everybody got sick at the exact same time. BUT there\u2019s this norovirus thing going on here in the US and the symptoms seem to match.\n\nAlso\u2026 the norovirus is waterborne and our filters don\u2019t filter virus, only bacteria \ud83e\udda0\ud83e\udd2f.\n\nWe\u2019re 13 people at Kenny\u2019s Place and so far only 4 are not sick. Fingers crossed, knocking on wood!\n\nIn any case, during the day I went to resupply. I thought Big Bear would be cosy like Idyllwild, but it was more like a bigger town, bigger streets kind of vibe. I went to the gear shop and to the supermarket and fully resupplied for 5-6 days. Kenny, such a nice dude, drove me and other healthy hikers back and forth.\n\nSo, I decided that I won\u2019t take a zero tomorrow. Physically I feel fine and I see no strong reason to stay here.

The day started slowly but soon we were making breakfast! Kenny made chili potatoes and sausages, Chilli Beans piloted the waffle machine, Google made scrambled eggs and Mermaid and me prepared a gigantic fruit salad!\n\nI was the only one in the house that was not going to take a zero: because I was feeling fine yesterday, I had time to resupply and I was feeling physically very good, so there\u2019s no need to take a zero. Kenny drove me back to the trail head around noon and I continued hiking north.\n\nMy plan was to hike 12-14 miles, but the trail was super simple and chill. The weather was also good, sunny but with lots of shade. I kept a good pace for more or less seven hours and ended up hiking almost 20 miles. On the way, I crossed paths with Max (the french dude whom I walked together on the first days)! We had a quick talk but both of us were on a mission to crush some miles. I finished my day a bit after 7, camping close to a water stream.\n\nAbout the outbreak yesterday: it seems that nobody before yesterday got sick (and I don\u2019t know today \u2014 I don\u2019t have internet at the moment to check). To me it still sounds weird that it\u2019s a virus. Nobody had fever and everybody was 90% fine after 24 hours. It looks more like poisoning or an intoxication of some sort. I was absolutely lucky to have skipped whatever part of the creek that was contaminated!

I even overslept a bit and left camp around 7:30. Before leaving, I saw Hanne (a girl from Belgium who\u2019s part of the first group I hiked with) and we talked a bit. She will hike the PCT only for 2 months, so she\u2019s skipping some parts. She skipped Mission Creek so she didn\u2019t get sick. I heard today that Clara (she\u2019s +/- 2 days behind me) also got sick with the water \ud83d\ude1e.\n\nThere were some river crossings today. Each crossing comes with its own challenges. Some you have to cross with your shoes, some it\u2019s better to go barefoot. Sometimes you can find rocks and tree branches and somehow make your way to the other side without getting wet. Sometimes it\u2019s better to use the hiking poles, sometimes it\u2019s better to store them in the backpack. On every crossing you have to remember to make wise decisions.\n\nNow that there\u2019s not much elevation gain and water isn\u2019t an issue, I\u2019ve been able to hike a little bit faster.  Even though today for whatever reason I hiked a bit backwards by accident, I was able to fish the day with almost 25 miles. That\u2019s a record for this trip \ud83c\udfc6!\n\nWhen I arrived at where I intended to camp, all spots were taken. I had to keep walking a bit more and found a very solitary place for my tent.

I heard that there was a \u201cFruit Dude\u201d that sells big cups of fresh fruit nearby. My plan was to go there first and then to Mc Donald\u2019s, so at least I had some healthy stuff on my stomach.\n\nUnfortunately the Fruit Dude was not there (although the stand was), so I went for plan B and decided to eat a Mc-anything-veggie. Except that they didn\u2019t have any veggie burgers, so I ended up ordering two big fries, a caramel sundae, coffee and ice tea. I devoured the fries and the sunday \ud83e\udd24! Finally I had good internet so I could also facetime Maike \ud83d\udc9c.\n\nI was not very amused with my breakfast so far.

I couldn\u2019t finish it! It was so good to eat so much fresh fruit \ud83c\udf49\ud83e\udd6d\ud83e\udd65!\n\nThe next step of the day was to hike ten more miles (it had taken me 10 miles to get to Mc Donald\u2019s) uphill and without water sources for the next 25 miles.

I thought today would be a 10 miles day, but it was in reality 17.5 (instead of hiking until close to the next town, Wrightwood, I had to hike until the highway, past Wrightwood). The biggest problem with this miscalculations is the potential lack of food and water. In this case, I lacked both.\n\nI only had about 3 liters for the whole day (I drink 1 liter every 4 or 5 miles) and I had no food other than 3 cliff bars.

This sounds like music to a thru-hiker (specially because there\u2019s no public laundry in Wrightwood).\n\nThis morning I had pizza for breakfast (I ended up eating the same pizza for dinner yesterday, breakfast, lunch and dinner today) and headed to the town center (which is literally a street with 4-5 shops and a few bars and restaurants). I resupplied both at the supermarket and at the equipment shop and I also grabbed my new pair of shoes that I had ordered back in Big Bear. Same shoes, same color, half a size up. I\u2019m calling them Two Goats.\n\nHiking-wise I feel super good. All my blisters are gone and I don\u2019t feel any pain. I believe I\u2019ve been eating the best I can, drinking properly and being careful regarding the sun. Because of that I\u2019ll try to have a bit more mileage without resupplying for the coming days/weeks. Tomorrow I leave with food for eight days! I\u2019m hoping water won\u2019t be much of a problem so I can carry less water and balance the weight out.\n\nAfter a lot of thoughts and considerations, tomorrow I\u2019ll do an alternate road trail instead of climbing up to Mount Baden-Powell. I chose that because I\u2019m fully loaded (with snacks and supplies \ud83c\udfb6) and I would need to carry a lot of water. It\u2019s around 9400 feet and it\u2019s all steep and icy, up and down. I\u2019m fine with road walk!\n\nAnother reason I chose to road walk is that I want to finally hike listening to music. So far, I haven\u2019t hiked a single minute listening to music, mostly so I could be aware of rattlesnakes. This morning, going back and forth to the town center, I could listen to music and it felt super good (thanks for Lemonade, Tessa!). I want to do the same tomorrow.\n\nA side effect of this decision is that I will carry my new shoes but I\u2019ll walk on my old shoes: they\u2019re currently very not-grippy but this is not a problem for road walk. As soon as I go back to the trail I\u2019ll swap them (and eventually discard my old pair of shoes). I also decided that I\u2019m not mailing forward any equipment (like the micro spikes \u2014 they won\u2019t be necessary until mile ~700).

It was a bit of s late start (around 10am) because I had to wait to get a ride from my host.

Before 6am today I had already left \u201ccamp\u201d and started hiking.\n\nFor the first 3/4 of the day, the pattern from yesterday repeated: going up and going down, managing water consumption, taking regular pauses for snacks. The days have been warm but bearable \ud83d\udc3b the water sources frequent enough. Not much to tell until I was about 4 miles from camp. I was feeling good, all my blisters are healed, the massage and the zero surely helped my body to rest and recover.\n\nI was already planning to have a break for a snack, drink water and rest a bit before the last two hiking hours of the day when I saw a sign \ud83e\udea7 for a hiker\u2019s party happening today with free food and drinks!\n\nThat was exactly it: a big table with all kinds of snacks plus sandwiches and burritos. Also cold beer, soda and gatorade! I don\u2019t know how, I don\u2019t know why, but everything for free.\n\nI spend 45 minutes eating apple, m&ms, trail mix, nuts, all types of cookies, celery, carrots, two cliff bars, doritos, raisins and drinking an ice cold orange gatorade!\n\nEverything was good but as it usually happens with me in parties, I soon got bored and decided to continue hiking. I thanked the trail angels and kept going. Even with the party pause, it was still around 5pm after I hiked the last 4 miles that I had planned for today. That\u2019s a bit too early to stop hiking so I kept pushing for 2 more hours and ended up at a proper camping place. They have showers, toilets and even have towels for the PCT hikers! So an unexpected and unplanned shower happened!\n\nI was about to write that the score now is 4 showers vs 3 pizzas, but someone here at the camping site just offered me more than half of a vegetarian pizza they couldn\u2019t handle.

I also wanted to check the general store that opened at 8am: because I got so much food for free yesterday, I thought about extending my next resupply for three more days. For that, though, I needed to find food for one more day either at this store or in 10 miles in a tiny town called Agua Dulce.\n\nThe general store was very unimpressive. I bought 2 frozen burritos for breakfast (they had a microwave) and 4 snickers. They also had free coffee for hikers!\n\nBefore leaving the campground I swapped my shoes and now I\u2019m officially on my second pair, Two Goats \u270c\ufe0f\ud83d\udc10. It\u2019s very impressive how a new pair of shoes make all the difference. The size (half a size up from my previous one) is perfect.\n\nI arrived at Agua Dulce at 1:30pm and I was starving. Because of the double burrito \ud83c\udf2f\ud83c\udf2f in the morning I didn\u2019t snack anything for 4 hours, but now I was very hungry. There was a Mexican restaurant literally on the PCT. If I had lunch here then I could have snacks for dinner and my food problem regarding the resupply would be solved!\n\nI didn\u2019t realize, but today is Mother\u2019s day here in the US (in Brazil too!). At the Mexican restaurant they were having a all you can eat buffet. Yes, that\u2019s right. Me, a starving hiker, in a all you can eat mexican buffet.\n\nMy first plate had 8 quesadillas on it. Plus rice, and beans and peppers and eggs with cheese. I don\u2019t remember the last time I ate so much in a single meal. And that was only the first plate.\n\nI was already fine after eating the first plate, but why not having a second? They had salads and fruits and waffles (?!) and sweets\u2026 I ended up having four plates and 1.5 liter of iced tea.\n\nHiking after that meal in the desert at 30 degrees uphill was an experience that I recommend to anyone. For the first two hours after having lunch I couldn\u2019t even drink water, so full I was. But everything was under control and now that I\u2019m in my tent writing this and seeing in retrospect, I think it was good that I ate a generous amount \ud83d\ude01. I didn\u2019t need to eat dinner so my food is perfect to hike for the next 100 miles without resupplying!\n\nAnother snake encounter, some rock views, tunnels and art were also part of this busy day \ud83d\ude0a!", "slug": "santa-clarita", "display_slug": "santa-clarita", "type": 1, "start_time": 1715570758.094051, "end_time": null, "creation_time": 1715571017.928118, "location": {"id": 126403601, "name": "Santa Clarita", "detail": "USA", "full_detail": "California, USA", "country_code": "US", "lat": 34.58397430370989, "lon": -118.32097526650719, "venue": null, "uuid": "21071769-2CF7-4663-879F-2951A45C01D3"}, "supertype": "normal", "is_deleted": false, "open_graph_id": null, "fb_publish_status": null, "timezone_id": "America/Los_Angeles", "views": 0, "comment_count": 1, "weather_condition": "clear-day", "weather_temperature": 31.0, "uuid": "7FC30026-15E3-49BD-BC31-AE6D32AE14C9"}, {"id": 102127814, "trip_id": 10158283, "location_id": 126403981, "main_media_item_path": null, "name": "Uninvited guests", "display_name": "Uninvited guests", "description": "Day 27\nMile 465.6 to mile 488.2\nPCT Miles: 22.6 (36.2km)\nTotal Miles: 488.2 (781.1km)\n\nSomething that I knew that inevitably was going to happen (and for sure will happen again), but you always hope that it just doesn\u2019t happen: I had my tent invaded by rodents during the night!\n\nI only found out this morning, because of the huge hole on the net of my tent and also on my food bag.

I looked ahead at the map and it seemed that the whole day would be a big flat walk. I like flat walks!

The aqueduct seems to be a known rough part of the trail (for those who don\u2019t have an umbrella \u2602\ufe0f\ud83d\ude09).\n\nI found out that yesterday I entered a wind farm territory that\u2019s open for PCT hikers. I had never heard this term before, but whoever decided to build a wind farm here had a very good idea. It winds a lot.\n\nIt was like on the first days of the PCT where it\u2019s not only sunny, hot and shadeless but it\u2019s also dry and the hot wind sucks all the moisture from you. You just sweat and feel thirsty all the time. And usually when you drink, the water it\u2019s lukewarm \ud83d\ude43.\n\nAt mile 549 there was such a cool spot maintained by a trail angel that looks like a bar, with chairs \ud83e\ude91, a library \ud83d\udcda with a few games and books, cookies and ramen (!) and most importantly: water. I made my lunch break there and met a few other hikers: Hammer, Chad, Red Lentils and No Map.\n\nNothing changed for the afternoon: hot, windy and dry. I was literally in the middle of hundreds of wind turbines (or whatever these are called). \n\nThe highlight of the day happened 4 miles before my final campsite. Right before a road crossing, this man was sitting in a camp chair by his truck and he offered me a cold gatorade (omg thanks) and we chatted a bit. He, Magicman, does this for nine years: he goes driving from Campo (where the PCT starts) to Oregon stopping here and there for a few days to offer cold drinks to PCT hikers. He stands the freaking whole day by his car where he has giant coolers full of cold drinks and he gives them for free to random stranger PCT hikers because he likes it. He never hiked the PCT himself and he doesn\u2019t accept any kind of donation.\n\nI\u2019m camping tonight in the middle of the wind farm hiding from the wind behind a juniper (?) tree. Now that I constantly now where North is, I know that the wind is coming from West and North-West so I positioned my tent accordingly to be more protected from the wind. I\u2019m feeling like I\u2019m the smartest person alive!

So after buying 80% of my resupply for the next seven days, I came to the hotel and chilled there (while recharging all my electronics which for the first time in this trip were all depleted). At 12:00 I had lavash wrap \ud83c\udf2f and fries \ud83c\udf5f and a delicious baklava from a mediterranean restaurant close by. I could check in early at the hotel at 13:00 and could finally take a shower \ud83e\uddfc!\n\nThe rest of the day was divided into doing the usual town duties: laundry (even though I believe my yellow sun hoodie will never look not dirty again. The picture is *after* it was washed!), duct taping my tent, food bag and my shorts \ud83e\ude73 (hopefully it will work better than my stitches \ud83e\udea1), going to the sports shop to buy more food and back to walmart once more to buy vegetables for dinner and other resupply items like toothpaste and tissues.\n\nTomorrow I start my last stretch in the desert \ud83c\udf35!

Granola, waffles, bagels, muffins, scrambled eggs, juices and coffee. I was weirdly proud on how much I could eat without feeling full.\n\nVery conveniently there\u2019s a bus \ud83d\ude8c to the trailhead where I left off. Precisely on time, at 9:30 \ud83d\udd64 it arrived and 20 minutes later I was hiking the PCT. Even better, the ride was free \ud83c\udd93!\n\nThe first eight miles would be an ascent and the next water source was in 16 miles. Besides food for seven days, I was carrying 3 liters of water plus 2 cans of nonalcoholic beer (leftovers from yesterday). It was not a bad idea to have kind-of-cold beer for the first two hydration stops of the day.\n\nMiraculously, hiking uphill under the sun wasn\u2019t so bad because of the strong wind. Maybe a bit annoying but at least not so exhausting. I was in good mood, feeling rested, so the day just flew by.\n\nSixteen miles later, at the water source, I checked and the next water would be in 20 miles! That means packing 5 liters of water. I decided to have dinner at the water source, so I wouldn\u2019t need to use water to cook later at camp. I cooked a bag of dehydrated mashed potatoes that is meant for 8 portions. After cooked, it weighed about 1.2kg. One point two kilos of food for dinner. And I was not even so full after that. Crazy!\n\nI kept walking for 5 more miles until I found a nice campsite where other 4-5 people are also camping. Since I didn\u2019t have to cook, I used my time to have a good stretch.

I\u2019ve done a fair amount of 10 before 10s and usually I hike for 6-7 hours (around 15 miles) before taking a break for lunch. Then in the afternoon I go with the flow, just hiking until I find a good place to camp (around 7pm).\n\nToday was completely the opposite.\n\nIt was a tough morning. I was carrying 4 liters of water (and my backpack is still full of food). The first water source was in 16 miles. It felt to me that it took forever for these miles to pass.\n\nBut eventually they did. I\u2019m back in the mountains so there\u2019s a lot of elevation, which disguises a bit the effort to hike a mile. The full backpack seems to weight three times more when you\u2019re hiking uphill.\n\nWhen I arrived at the water source (a pipe coming out of nowhere), I took a longer break than usual. I had lunch, cameled up (drink a lot of water) and chatted a bit with Aragorn (danish, father of 3, quit his job and is doing the PCT) and Dust (german, attempted last year but gave up because of the high amount of snow. Came back this year to finish what he started). These weird names, by the way, are \u201ctrail names\u201d. I\u2019ll talk about trail names in a post soon.\n\nTaking a longer break (also it took a long time to filter the not-so-clean water) recharged my batteries a bit. I was planning to do around 21 miles today, but I decided to keep hiking for 4 miles more.

I left camp before 6am and the sun was already out. It\u2019s very easy to observe that the sun is rising earlier and earlier.\n\nToday was an interesting day in the sense that, since yesterday, the next two water sources (that provide water for ~40 miles) are two caches maintained by a trail angel \ud83d\udc7c. I have no idea what hikers would do without those water caches.\n\nDuring the night the winds were crazy. Surprisingly in the morning it was just a breeze but it picked up in the afternoon and there were some strong gusts that were a little bit scary. I really hope this wind thing is something from this region and that in the Sierra things will be calmer\n\nI was feeling much more energized than yesterday and hiked in a very good pace, even though there were quite some uphills. As I eat, the backpack is becoming lighter. Also I realized that if I keep the daily mileage around 24 miles instead of 20, I can arrive in Kennedy Meadows South (the official end of the desert and beginning of the Sierra) one day earlier than I planned. I did well yesterday and did well today, so things are on track. For tomorrow I\u2019ll have to hike at least 25 miles because of water reasons.

So well that I woke up after 6 and didn\u2019t leave camp until 6:40, which usually is not ideal.\n\nIt turned out though that after a few steps I stop for a quick chat with this hiker who was sitting on a rock smoking a cigarette. Chezwick is his name. He started the PCT on May 2nd (!) and is doing an average of 35 miles per day. He finishes his cigarette and we hike together for the whole morning, around 12 miles for a quick lunch break. He eats cold soaked something (maybe knorr pasta?) with a lot of olive oil and SPAM \ud83e\udd22. I eat a double cheese double peanut butter pita bread \ud83d\ude0b.\n\nThis is the fourth time Chezwick is doing the PCT. He finished it three times already and he wants to finish this time in less than 80 days. Then, he will attempt to, before the end of the year, thru-hike both the CDT (Continental Divide Trail) and the AT (Appalachian Trail) and aim to beat the record of the fastest self-supported triple-crowner in a single calendar year! (self-supported: no assistance from friends or family; triple-crowner: someone who thru-hikes the AT, CDT and PCT)\n\nAfter lunch and refilling water (third water cache in a row) we parted ways since the next part was an uphill and I usually take my time on those. After a steep climb of almost three hours, I meet Chezwick at the top of the mountain, sitting on a rock, smoking a cigarette (that\u2019s when I took the selfie). You climbed pretty fast, he says, and we once more hike for about three hours, talking about hiking and motivation and why we do those things and why wouldn\u2019t we do those things. Around 7pm we arrived at my camping spot. Chezwick had a quick \u201chalf ciggy\u201d pause (sitting on a rock) and we said goodbye. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever meet him again, but I\u2019m so thankful that I had the chance to spend this day hiking with him.\n\nOn one of the many topics we chatted, I told Chezwick that I was a little bit anxious about the Sierras. There are so many unknowns and challenges that I can\u2019t even imagine that I feel scared about it. \u201cYou got this, Bruno\u201d, he said. \u201cI can see that you really like to hike and that\u2019s what\u2019s important. The Sierra is the most beautiful place on Earth and all the challenges will be worth it. It\u2019s going to be tough, but it\u2019s going to incredible, I promise\u201d. That\u2019s exactly what I needed to hear.\n\nThis day and the inspiring conversations with Chezwick set my mood up and made me excited about the next stage on the PCT. The only situations in the desert that I didn\u2019t feel comfortable were related to snow and/or ice. And this is what the Sierra is about: snow and ice (and elevation and beautiful views). Come, Sierra! I\u2019m ready for you!\n\nTalking about records, at the end of the day I broke my distance record for a single day hiking the PCT (or ever): 45km!\n\nPS: bonus picture of my feet moments before I go to sleep.", "slug": "kern-county", "display_slug": "kern-county", "type": 1, "start_time": 1716344976.001424, "end_time": null, "creation_time": 1716345148.832078, "location": {"id": 127778345, "name": "Kern County", "detail": "USA", "full_detail": "California, USA", "country_code": "US", "lat": 35.76031303621661, "lon": -118.0407825256496, "venue": null, "uuid": "59AC298A-014D-480C-9878-81B2DB3C94F6"}, "supertype": "normal", "is_deleted": false, "open_graph_id": null, "fb_publish_status": null, "timezone_id": "America/Los_Angeles", "views": 0, "comment_count": 2, "weather_condition": null, "weather_temperature": null, "uuid": "0E00D410-EFCD-4EB2-973A-8A68624E6CF0"}, {"id": 103417542, "trip_id": 10158283, "location_id": 127946347, "main_media_item_path": null, "name": "\ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udf35\ud83d\udc2a So long and thanks for all the heat", "display_name": "\ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udf35\ud83d\udc2a So long and thanks for all the heat", "description": "Day 36\nMile 667.7 to Kennedy Meadows South\nPCT Miles: 35.7 (57.1km)\nTotal Miles: 703.4 (1125.4km)\n\nI cannot hide that yesterday I was inspired by my conversations with Chezwick. I feel like, somehow, hiking with him transferred a bit of his determination and discipline to me. \n\nToday I was hiking before 6am and my plan was to break my hiking record from yesterday and hike 30 miles. That sounded plausible, so I went for it. The idea was to get as close as possible to Kennedy Meadows South (KMS), so I could arrive there tomorrow morning. Things turned out a bit differently though.\n\nKennedy Meadows South is probably the most famous \u201ctown\u201d in the whole PCT. The \u201ctown\u201d is composed literally by these three shops (a General Store, a bar/restaurant and an outfitter) that serve PCT hikers during the hiking season. KMS is also the divider between the first part of the PCT (desert) and the most challenging part, the Sierra Nevada.\n\nStopping at KMS is almost mandatory for PCT hikers. First, for resupply. Second, to fix, change or improve the gear, since things will be very different in the coming 400 miles than they were in the past 700. It will be much colder, lots of snow, much higher altitude and there will be a lot of elevation gain/loss every single day. Hikers also gather here to team up (it\u2019s not advised to go to the Sierra alone). You need to bring micro spikes, an ice axe and it\u2019s compulsory to have a bear can (I\u2019ll tell more about the bear can later).\n\nBack to my day: it was an intense day, since I was pushing myself since early morning, but nothing absurd. I was 99% sure that I was going to stop when I reached 30 miles and leave the remaining 6 for tomorrow. I arrived at the camping spot around 7pm, but apparently it\u2019s a popular camping spot (close to a stream) and it was a bit too crowded. There was this girl with a punctured sleeping mattress surrounded by 4-5 guys trying to help. There was someone complaining that mice had just eaten their food and there was this other guy trying to lecture everybody about the Sierra. I don\u2019t even know from where those people came from, but there was too much going on for me. I refilled my water and very spontaneously decided to keep going until Kennedy Meadows. That would mean that I was going to hike a bit in the dark, which is something that I\u2019m usually not comfortable with. In my mind I could hear Chezwick telling me that this is why we\u2019re here: to overcome these fears. Little by little, one by one.\n\nMy short night hike was absolutely incredible. I didn\u2019t even need to use my headlamp because the moon \ud83c\udf15 was so so so bright. And knowing that I was about to finish the day hiking more than 50km and breaking my record from yesterday made me feel invincible!\n\nI\u2019m proud of myself. It was a big day and I feel like I\u2019m improving physically while still making wise decisions, day by day.\n\nAnd by the way: Bye, desert!

I woke up around 6 and went to the porch of the general store (which basically IS Kennedy Meadows). There, at 7am, they serve breakfast: all you can eat pancakes and coffee. That\u2019s a good way to start a zero!\n\nIt was good to finally have internet again. I could upload the last days here on Polarsteps and call Maike \ud83d\udc9c. I could also charge all my devices: phone, watch, headlamp, gps and power bank. Fully loaded for the coming 8~10 in the Sierra!\n\nSpending a zero day camping on the backyard\nof a general store (with focus almost exclusively on PCT hikers) is surely interesting. During the day you can resupply, drink a beer, have a burger, fix your gear, send or receive packages. On the backyard there\u2019s also an outfitter store, selling literally any piece of clothing or equipment you might need for the Sierra. I spend almost four hours (!!!) on this store (which is inside a trailer, super tiny) talking to the owner Charlie Brown. I asked every possible question I could imagine about crossing the Sierra with safety. He seemed happy to help and answer my questions.\n\nStarting tomorrow for the coming 500 miles or so, I\u2019m required to carry a bear can. So, besides resupply it, I also bought one today (surprise, at the general store). Lastly, I made some improvements to my gear to be better prepared for the colder weather and be safer hiking on snowy/icy ground: I replaced my micro spikes for proper crampons, bought an ice axe \ud83e\ude93 (for safety), another puff jacket, gloves \ud83e\udde4, a pair of merino bottom base layer (to sleep on) and waterproof socks \ud83e\udde6. I also replaced the thin sleeping mat that I was using for a thicker, warmer one.\n\nOther than that, the atmosphere here is pretty festive. There\u2019s clearly a vibe of accomplishment, after finishing the desert part. You can also feel a subtle apprehension in the air. We are all about to start the most challenging part of the PCT after all.\n\nMy plan is to start hiking tomorrow after breakfast \ud83e\udd5e. I\u2019m bringing food for 8-9 days. My plan A is to hike 180 miles in one go. My plan B is to stop earlier and hitch to a town. In theory I don\u2019t need to resupply, but if I need to go to town for whatever reason, there will be a few places that I can hitch to town. My plan AA is to go a bit further and reach Mammoth Lakes \ud83e\udda3, 200 miles away.\n\nSierra Nevada, here I come!", "slug": "inyokern", "display_slug": "inyokern", "type": 1, "start_time": 1716524645.901744, "end_time": null, "creation_time": 1716524701.242226, "location": {"id": 127947725, "name": "Inyokern", "detail": "USA", "full_detail": "California, USA", "country_code": "US", "lat": 36.020097585018284, "lon": -118.12346183333224, "venue": null, "uuid": "285BB52D-73BE-4717-9330-8C4AEE474092"}, "supertype": "normal", "is_deleted": false, "open_graph_id": null, "fb_publish_status": null, "timezone_id": "America/Los_Angeles", "views": 0, "comment_count": 9, "weather_condition": "clear-day", "weather_temperature": 34.0, "uuid": "D1DD99E2-311B-44ED-9249-44F4A0585616"}, {"id": 104441374, "trip_id": 10158283, "location_id": 129170998, "main_media_item_path": null, "name": "Entering the Sierra Nevada", "display_name": "Entering the Sierra Nevada", "description": "Day 38\nKennedy Meadows South to mile 723.0\nPCT Miles: 19.6 (31.4km)\nTotal Miles: 723.0 (1156.8km)\n\nThe day cannot start wrong if it starts with all you can eat pancakes \ud83e\udd5e! At 8, I was (almost) fully packed and eating my breakfast. It was a challenge to reorganize things so I can fit the crampons, ice axe and specially the bear canister into my backpack. It was also a challenge to fit my food into the bear canister.\n\nStarting today and for the rest of the Sierra Nevada, it\u2019s mandatory to carry a bear canister, which is a big bear-proof container \ud83e\uded9. There are two main disadvantages of carrying the bear canister. First, it\u2019s heavy: 1.13kg. Second, it limits the amount of food you can carry. In theory, you should also put on the bear canister scented things like toothpaste or even sunscreen. I forgot to take a picture to show to you how mine looks like. I will do tomorrow (if I remember \ud83d\ude05).\n\nAfter breakfast (prepared by the mega-friendly Huckleberry), I was ready to go! I said my goodbyes to the other hikers, put my backpack \ud83c\udf92 on, buckled the hip belt and\u2026 the hip belt buckle snaps in two. It\u2019s broken and it\u2019s very visible that there\u2019s no way to fix the buckle.\n\nI\u2019m in the middle of nowhere and I need a new very-specific buckle to repair my backpack. For a moment I think about going without the buckle (and therefore not being able to use the hip belt), but I remembered the mantra \u201cmake wise decisions\u201d and carrying 15kg on your shoulders only is definitely not wise. The solution would be to order a new buckle online\u2026 I was already preparing myself mentally to have a few zeros until the new buckle arrives.\n\nI went to the general store and they even have a buckle, but it\u2019s too small, it not even half of the width of the strap. Then I went to the hiker box (a hiker box is a big box where hikers leave what they don\u2019t want or need anymore, so other hikers can use) and there was a big old backpack there! The backpack itself couldn\u2019t be used, but I could remove the hip belt buckle! Believe or not, somebody had this idea before: there were no buckles anymore.\n\nMy last resort was to check with Charlie Brown if he had the buckle. He didn\u2019t have any on his shop, but he said that he was about to receive a box with some spare parts. Maybe later today or tomorrow that box would arrive and maybe there could be a hip belt buckle there. A lot of maybes.\n\nHe went to the general store to check for his mail and for his surprise (and mine) his box had just arrived this morning. I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes when he shows me the *one* hip belt buckle that came in the box!\n\nForty minutes later, after Charlie Brown stitched \ud83e\udea1 the new buckle (and refuse to receive any payment for that) I was ready to go! I put my backpack on, buckle my hip belt and\u2026 everything is perfect \ud83e\udd29!\n\nI started hiking at 11:30 and hiked almost non-stop until 19, after almost 20 miles. There was already a lot of altitude change today (mostly uphill) and I\u2019m sleeping at almost 10.000 feet of altitude. The wind is becoming colder and colder (in contrast with the warm wind from the desert) and I saw already a few snow patches.

Great hike, beautiful views, no snow to be seen. Since there are no more rattlesnakes to be heard, I could even listen to music for a few hours (I hate listening to music going uphill, but when it\u2019s flat or downhill, I love it!). Everything was perfect. Then the first snow patches showed up.\n\nIn the beginning they appeared very sporadically and you could easily go around then. It didn\u2019t take long until I had to hike on snow. Since it was mostly flat, it was fine to hike without the crampons. It was late afternoon and the snow was melting, so easy to slip. And I did a few times. But it was on patch of dirt though that I lost my balance and felt. Nothing serious, silly fall. But somehow I broke one of my hiking poles (the one that was already bent from a previous fall) in half.\n\nI kept hiking with only one pole (what could I do?) until the snow became much more abundant. I made a wise decision and put my crampons on. I hiked probably around two hours with them. Later the snow became patchy only and I took the crampons off.\n\nThe last half an hour of hiking was a bit miserable. The melting snow was so soft that my feet would sink in on every step. When I arrived at camp, my shoes, socks and feet were completely damp. I quickly dried my feet and put on dry socks.

Sleeping socks and sleeping pants make all the difference \ud83d\ude34!\n\nThere was some frost on my backpack and tent and also my shoes were frozen. It\u2019s really not the best feeling to wear frozen shoes (and socks) on a cold morning.\n\nThe morning was tough, but great! Most of the trail was covered in snow, but since it freezes during the night, it\u2019s hard snow in the morning. It\u2019s so much easier to hike in hard snow instead of soft, icy or slushy snow!\n\u2028Even though I camped alone (and so far I\u2019m camping alone again tonight) I saw a lot of people on trail today. My goal today was to reach the base of the Forester Pass, arguably the most challenging part of the whole PCT. For that, I had to hike 25 miles with a lot of ups and downs.\n\nThe problem with that math that used to work in the desert is that there are some parts in the Sierra that you just cannot (or shouldn\u2019t) do at certain times. For example, to go over a high pass (like Forester Pass), you should do it early in the morning, while the snow is still hard. Or if you\u2019re going to cross a river or creek with a strong current, you should also do in the mornings, because the flow will be much calmer since the water freezes overnight.\n\nThat was I learned today. After hiking 21.5km, I arrived at a river crossing around 4:30pm. It\u2019s the first time that I face a river crossing that is just too strong to move on, specially alone. Even if there would be more people, I wouldn\u2019t cross it today.\n\nIt was the earlier finish of a hiking day so far and also the first time that I don\u2019t reach the goal that I set for the day. I confess that I was a bit disappointed, but now that I cooked, stretched, reorganize my backpack and had time to listen to music and podcasts and it\u2019s not even 19:00, I feel completely fine \ud83d\ude43.", "slug": "tulare-county", "display_slug": "tulare-county", "type": 1, "start_time": 1716773304.636699, "end_time": null, "creation_time": 1716776857.209951, "location": {"id": 129173646, "name": "Tulare County", "detail": "USA", "full_detail": "California, USA", "country_code": "US", "lat": 36.597792033242165, "lon": -118.37517997853686, "venue": null, "uuid": "1E7B0FC9-AB4F-4FCE-874C-86FA38B38BA9"}, "supertype": "normal", "is_deleted": false, "open_graph_id": null, "fb_publish_status": null, "timezone_id": "America/Los_Angeles", "views": 0, "comment_count": 2, "weather_condition": "clear-day", "weather_temperature": 12.0, "uuid": "23BA5B89-D797-476D-BD78-6FB3D8885D14"}, {"id": 104445593, "trip_id": 10158283, "location_id": 129176137, "main_media_item_path": null, "name": "Forester Pass \ud83c\udfd4\ufe0f", "display_name": "Forester Pass \ud83c\udfd4\ufe0f", "description": "Day 41\nMile 772.2 to mile 790.1\nPCT Miles: 17.9 (28.6km)\nTotal Miles: 790.1 (1264.2km)\n\nI knew I had a very challenging day ahead.\n\nIt was the earliest that I left camp so far, around 5:30. The day started with the river crossing that ended my day yesterday. This morning the stream was indeed slower. I tried first to use a log to cross, but it was frozen and slippery, so I went for it and crossed walking. Refreshing feet (and shoes) wash!\n\nMy day was 90% hiking on snow. In the morning, when the snow is still hard, it\u2019s almost as easy as hiking on ground. It took me around three hours to finally put my crampons on. The day was going according to the plan!\n\nThen it was time to cross the Forester Pass. The highest point on the PCT.\n\nThere was absolutely no trail to follow. The whole thing was covered in ice. Instead of hiking, the ascend was climbing on ice. It was the first time in my life that I had an ice axe in hand. And I was so glad I did.\n\nI completely ignored the trail, which was full of switchbacks (i.e. zig-zags), and went straight up following some footprints. In one moment, I had to use my ice axe as a third contact point to be able to push myself up. It was freaking crazy scary. Now, looking back, I would say it was fun. In the moment, I was so tense and so scared. I took my time and eventually succeeded on the ascent!\n\nGoing down was a completely different story. I glissaded (sit on the snow and slide down\ud83d\udedd) the first part of the descending (that was fun!!), but it was a long way down still after that. The snow was already softening with the sun so it became more difficult to hike.\n\nBesides the early stream crossing, there were three more (actually five, because I miss crossed one river and had to cross back). That plus hiking on the snow means that my feet were wet all day long. Tomorrow seems to be a wear-frozen-socks-and-shoes day\u2026\n\nDuring the afternoon my mood dropped a bit. I was a little bit miserable with all the wetness and because I was hiking so slow because of the snow. I enjoy hiking fast, I like walking. I don\u2019t necessarily enjoy hiking on snow (but I accept the challenge). I had to, again, stop hiking earlier than I wanted because there wouldn\u2019t be a place to camp if I kept hiking up (full of snow). Tomorrow I\u2019ll try to go over the next pass (Glen Pass) before 7am.\n\nAlmost at the end of the day, I had my first encounter with deers \ud83e\udd8c and for some reason I was super scared. Maybe because it\u2019s a big wild animal and I don\u2019t even remember if I have ever been so close to a wild animal like this. I saw two or three and the last one was not shy at all.

That\u2019s it.\n\nThe terrain is also much more complicated. It\u2019s mostly snow, but it can be hard snow, soft snow, slushy snow. There are a lot of parts on the trail that are only rocks, and that\u2019s super hard on ankles and knees. And it\u2019s a lot of elevation.\n\nFor the past days I\u2019ve been learning about hiking in conditions completely new to me. I\u2019m also trying to enjoy my time here more (it\u2019s truly beautiful) and to be chill with the fact that I\u2019m doing less miles. That\u2019s perfectly fine.\n\nFor a few reasons I decided today that I\u2019m going for my plan B: in three or four days I\u2019ll take the Bishop Pass to exit the Sierra to resupply. It\u2019s all good, everything is fine! I\u2019ll explain the reasons when I get to Bishop.\n\nWell, today I woke up, wore frozen shoes and started my day early, heading to Glen Pass, my second pass in the Sierra. Everything was fine and for my surprise I saw two other hikes when I reached the top of the pass! It had been a while since I saw other human beings.\n\nI briefly talked to them (Tangent and Bullfrog), but they were hiking too fast for me. So I kept going on my own pace. The way down from Glen Pass was a bit harsh in the knees and my right knee started complaining a bit. It doesn\u2019t help much that I\u2019ve been hiking with only one pole (that\u2019s one reason that I\u2019m going to Bishop)\n\nA little before lunch I met another hiker, Fizz, who was still camped. He said that he was taking the day easy, because yesterday was too much for him. When I stopped for lunch, he showed up a few minutes later and we had lunch together. \n\nWhile we were having lunch, a couple showed up. I talked to them and explained a bit that I was going to Bishop because I really need to resupply and I\u2019m actually running low on food (that\u2019s another reason that I need to go to Bishop). \n\nThey (Carson and Handstand) told me that they were not doing the PCT, but a different trail. They had planned to hike for a few days, but they were bailing out because of the amount of snow on their trail. \u201cDo you want our food?\u201d, they asked. Oh yeah!\n\nIn the end I got just food for one more day. Now I\u2019m much more confident that I will make to Bishop and resupply. Good \ud83d\udc4d!\n\nAfter lunch I kept hiking (to as close as I can from the next pass, Pinchot Pass) and most of the trail was snow free, but it was very, very wet. Multiple stream crossings and wet feet for the whole afternoon. And that also means frozen shoes and socks tomorrow morning \ud83e\udd76.\n\nAbout one hour before I finished the day, I saw Fizz hiking a bit behind me.

I was awake at 5 and left camp at 5:40. There was a layer of frost over my tent and my backpack and my sleeping bag was wet on the outside due to the condensation. That plus wet socks and shoes is always fun!\n\nGoing over today\u2019s pass, Pinchot Pass, was quite uneventful. I met Tangent, Bullfrog and Geezer on the way up and going down was also chill wearing the crampons.\n\nAfter that, and before ascending to the next pass, Mather Pass, I crossed the most challenging stream so far. I had to hike upstream for almost one hour to find a good spot to cross. But all good \ud83d\udc4d!\n\nI took a break for an early lunch when I found a good spot with water, shade and a big rock to put my things to dry (tent, sleeping bag, socks). I knew that the day was already close to an end: the ascent to Mather Pass after 12pm was very difficult with the soft snow. I slowly climbed up until it was too much effort for not much gain. Again, it\u2019s much better to do the ascent early in the morning, when the snow is refrozen overnight.\n\nAround 14:30 I met Tangent, Bullfrog and Geezer again. They were having a lunch break. Soon after Fizz also showed up and we chilled together a bit.\n\nI decided that that was it for the day! My body (mainly my legs) would really appreciate an afternoon off. I\u2019m in one of the most beautiful places on the planet, it\u2019s almost mandatory that I slow down and enjoy a bit! I found a nice spot for my tent and slowly I\u2019m doing all the chores, stretching, reorganizing my things and also planning for the coming days. All of that surrounded by gorgeous mountains.

I just had to get out of the tent to pee during the night, but it was totally worth it! The sky was full of stars and absolutely divine! I can\u2019t wait for new moon to do some stargazing here in the Sierra Nevada!\n\nI woke up completely rested and it was my earliest start ever. At 5:26 I was already heading to today\u2019s pass: Mather Pass. After around 45 minutes hiking, I met Tangent, Bullfrog, Geezer and Fizz again. They were discussing the best approach to climb the ice wall to the summit, which lied just in front of us.\n\nEverybody with spikes or crampons on and ice axe in hands, we started the climb. I went to a not very good route and ended up facing something more vertical that I felt comfortable with. I had to use my axe to carve footholds on the snow so I could advance. For maybe half an hour I climbed using my axe as a third point of contact on the frozen mountain. It was nerve wracking but at the end I did it! For me, Mather Pass and Forester Pass are tied as the most difficult passes.\n\nAfter summiting, it comes an exhausting way down, also in snow. The difference is: now there\u2019s sunshine and the snow is starting to melt.\n\nOn the way down I found a nice little pool and went for my first alpine swim! The water was freaking cold but the sun afterwards quickly warmed up! Skinny-dipping in the Sierras \u2705!\n\nSince it was a big descent, after a while the snow was completely gone. That means normal hiking speed! So much better! I met again Tangent, Bullfrog and Geezer at lunch time and we hiked together for the whole afternoon. They have a pace similar to mine and they also need to make it to Bishop tomorrow, for food reasons. Perfect!\n\nSo, at the moment I\u2019m on a trail (Bishop Pass Trail) to exit the Sierra and go to town (Bishop). This trail is about 13 miles long (I\u2019m 1.5 miles in) and there\u2019s the pass in 4.5 miles.

I woke up around 4:30 but everybody was in a chill vibe, given that the day ahead would apparently be easy. We left camp around 6am.\n\nThe first 3 hours in the morning were all uphill as we summited to the pass. To go up, we didn\u2019t need traction (spikes or crampons) nor an ice axe. It was the easiest pass so far. On the way down I put my crampons to feel safer. Almost the entire trail going down was under (melting) snow so it was an intense exercise on the legs. I lost contact with my group during the descent and I since I was 99% sure that I would make it to the trailhead, I took my time to hike down.\n\nWhen I arrived to the trailhead, I didn\u2019t see any of my 3 companions: either they were already gone (meaning they got a hitch to town) or I accidentally passed them on trail without noticing (possible, since it was so much snow that it becomes a \u201cmake your own path\u201d situation). In any case, I had to find a ride to town (17 miles). The main problem is that I was not in a street or highway. I was in the trailhead parking lot, meaning that my chances to get a ride were very limited.\n\nOn my third attempt to ask for a ride, I went to these three ladies who had just left the trail. It was around 1pm, so I assumed they went for a morning hike. When I asked them if they could by any chance give me a ride to Bishop, one of them promptly replied: of course! Let\u2019s go!\n\nIt was an delightful ride talking about the PCT, hiking season, Bishop and what not. Thank you so much Sports Girl and Angie for the ride! They literally left me at the front door of the hostel (which was full, so I ended up in an inn called Vagabond Inn for tonight.\n\nFirst thing in town? Pizza! Second thing? Shower!\n\nI used the rest of the afternoon to go to the gear shop to buy some things I need: flip flops (no more walking barefoot or with wet shoes at the end of the hiking days), carabiners to better attach things to my backpack and food. I also went to the supermarket to buy more food. I noticed that the amount of food that I was eating in the desert isn\u2019t being enough for the Sierra: I need to eat more. So this time I\u2019m making sure that I pack more food. I think my limit with the bear canister is to bring food for 6 days.\n\nI will take at least one zero here in Bishop (maybe two). Even though I don\u2019t have any blister or serious injury, these part days were TOUGH. My legs are exhausted and they need rest (specially my right knee). I\u2019m very happy that I\u2019m not hiking tomorrow. This is the first reason I came to Bishop.\n\nThe second reason, is that I completely ran out of food. When I arrived at the trailhead, I had literally zero food left. I thought I could do 180 miles with the food I brought from Kennedy Meadows 8 days ago. The food lasted one day less than I thought (thank you Carson and Handstand for giving me extra food on trail!) and only made around 140 miles, 25% less than I planned. If in the desert I was doing at least\n25 miles a day, in the Sierra I\u2019m doing an average of 17 (and feeling three times more exhausted). Lesson learned!\n\nThe third reason is that I need to buy new hiking poles, since I broke one of mine. I can feel in each step that I\u2019m hiking with one pole, specially on elevation. I\u2019m pretty sure that that\u2019s why my right knee is complaining.\n\nLastly, there\u2019s a bridge over a river 20 miles ahead that is broken and the PCTA (the PCT Association) suggest hikers to do an alternative route to bypass that river. To do this alternative route, you have to leave the trail where I did and re-join through another trail. That\u2019s what I plan to do. There are people trying to cross the river without the bridge. Some of them are succeeding and some do them are being swept away. I\u2019m completely fine not trying it \ud83d\ude0a.", "slug": "bishop", "display_slug": "bishop", "type": 1, "start_time": 1717218144.874597, "end_time": null, "creation_time": 1717218372.003797, "location": {"id": 129459262, "name": "Bishop", "detail": "USA", "full_detail": "California, USA", "country_code": "US", "lat": 37.37210077255006, "lon": -118.39374201265689, "venue": null, "uuid": "1E987337-5FA6-4EE5-A539-FE781E731180"}, "supertype": "normal", "is_deleted": false, "open_graph_id": null, "fb_publish_status": null, "timezone_id": "America/Los_Angeles", "views": 0, "comment_count": 3, "weather_condition": "clear-day", "weather_temperature": 33.0, "uuid": "A66DC95C-5388-45A1-B977-54B217A2DC7C"}, {"id": 104686978, "trip_id": 10158283, "location_id": 129467530, "main_media_item_path": null, "name": "Welcome to The Hostel California! \ud83c\udfb6", "display_name": "Welcome to The Hostel California! \ud83c\udfb6", "description": "Day 46\nPCT Miles: 0\nTotal Miles: 832.2 (1331.5km)\n\nToday was by far my best zero day since I started the PCT. And big part of it was due the THC (The Hostel California)!\n\nAs it has happened before, I didn\u2019t sleep very well. Maybe the bed was too comfortable, maybe I missed my stinky sleeping bag. In any case, I was up at 5 and had a cheap breakfast at Vagabond Inn. I used the morning to slowly pack my stuff, upload some of the posts here to Polarsteps, check next steps on trail, etc. I could feel my right knee hurting and I noticed that I was walking like an old man. At noon I decided to have a 90 minutes massage. It was spectacular and I few like a new human being now! Time to check-in at The Hostel California, where I\u2019ll be spending two nights!\n\nWhat a crazy place! On the outside the hostel looks cute and colorful. On the inside it\u2019s also cute and colorful and It looks like a hippie community. There must be place for 30+ people here. There are big shared rooms (with instruments, books, movies, skateboards, loan clothes, hiker boxes), big dining area, big kitchen and a big big garden. There are marijuana plants \ud83e\udeb4 everywhere and there\u2019s free weed for guests. Yes, that\u2019s right: it\u2019s a hostel with open bar of weed!\n\nAs you can imagine, the vibe here is as chill as it can get. There are a lot of shops, bars, restaurants and services (laundry, post, etc) nearby. I honestly feel like I\u2019m back in S\u00e3o Carlos (the university town that I studied) in a shared student house. I love it!\n\nMy biggest mission for today was to fix my hiking pole. I didn\u2019t want to buy a new pair, because it was just one that was broke and also I like my poles (they have shock absorption and I didn\u2019t see a similar model on the shops yet). I went to all the three shops in town, one of them selling used gear. So far, no luck. Seems like I\u2019ll have to spend ~120 dollars to buy a pair of poles worst then mine. Not ideal.\n\nWhile I was thinking about the best solution, I went to the laundromat and I met Fizz there! Fizz tells me that on the last river crossing he made a mistake and he had to sacrifice one of his poles to the river gods. He was thrilled because he had just found a good deal at the used gear shop and bought a new set for 30 bucks! I guess he was faster than me \ud83d\ude29.\n\nBut \u201chey!\u201d, he says, \u201cmaybe we can fix your pole with my old pole, since I don\u2019t need it anymore\u201d. I\u2019m not very hopeful it will work out. We wait for our clothes to be finished and walk back to THC (he is also staying there). When we arrive we met Tangent and he was super happy because he also had broken one of his poles and found a replacement at the hiker box! Why do I always forget the hiker boxes? \ud83e\udd2c! I present you Polenstein!\n\nFizz gives me his pole and with a little bit of effort I swamp the middle shaft that was broken on mine and\u2026 it works!!! I can\u2019t believe it! My hiking poles are fully functional again and it costed me zero money! Fizz refuses to accept any payment for it: \u201cdude, I\u2019m happy myself that I found a good deal and I was going to leave this pole on the hiker box anyways. I\u2019m happy it all worked out!\u201d and he lights a joint. He looks happy and I\u2019m thrilled to have two hiking poles again!\n\nI went out one more time to eat (I somehow forgot to have lunch) and had a gigantic veggie burrito (man, food in America always comes in generous servings). It was already end of the afternoon and I just chilled here and drank my delicious non-alcoholic hazy IPA beer (from Athletic Brewing, one of the best non-alcoholic beers I\u2019ve ever had) until it was hiker\u2019s midnight (9pm) and therefore time to sleep \ud83d\ude34.\n\nTomorrow I\u2019ll have another zero!", "slug": "bishop", "display_slug": "bishop", "type": 1, "start_time": 1717298496.156984, "end_time": null, "creation_time": 1717298660.33291, "location": {"id": 129467530, "name": "Bishop", "detail": "USA", "full_detail": "California, USA", "country_code": "US", "lat": 37.36345305333555, "lon": -118.39655681783431, "venue": null, "uuid": "992D1A18-9896-4AF5-815F-60F981A73CD6"}, "supertype": "normal", "is_deleted": false, "open_graph_id": null, "fb_publish_status": null, "timezone_id": "America/Los_Angeles", "views": 0, "comment_count": 6, "weather_condition": "clear-day", "weather_temperature": 34.0, "uuid": "2CA4C1EC-7FBC-4590-A1F2-D3F373A6551E"}, {"id": 104823345, "trip_id": 10158283, "location_id": 129633318, "main_media_item_path": null, "name": "Double Zero", "display_name": "Double Zero", "description": "Today I did absolutely nothing.

I had all my stuff packed so I had time to make coffee and eat a breakfast burrito \ud83c\udf2f that I ordered yesterday. Good start of the day!\n\nAt 8am we (me, Tangent, Bullfrog and Geezer) started our road walk (around 12 miles) from the trailhead that we got off the PCT and the next trailhead that will bring us back to the PCT and skip the part with the broken bridge. Since we knew that we wouldn\u2019t advance much on the trail (we will hike the Piute Pass tomorrow morning), we took it easy. The weather was good for a road walk (a bit cloudy). We were stopped by Outside Jay, a trail angel, and he offered us donuts \ud83c\udf69. We got two each \ud83d\ude0b. After that, around lunch time, we walked a bit out of the way from our path to have coffee and pie at a small cafe.

After we crossed it, the trail was very wet and there were multiple stream crossings, so today was wet feet day. The last stream crossing was 10 minutes before camp so my shoes will be soaked (and probably frozen) tomorrow.\n\nAfter hiking the 17 miles of the Piute Pass Trail, we re-joined the PCT after the broken bridge.

At 9 we started the descent\u2026 which took a while.\n\nThere was a lot of soft snow. The temperature didn\u2019t drop enough overnight to really refreeze the snow on that side of the mountain. So it was a tough descent, until a point where there was no snow. Then it was the type of hike that I enjoy the most: clear defined trail, challenging but without snow.\n\nAfter having lunch (me and Geezer only, the other two stayed behind) we started another ascent. At the top, there was a junction with another trail and a nice space to chill. Geezer decided to take a break and wait for the other two and I continued.\n\nTwo miles later, when I checked on the map, I actually took the wrong trail at the junction and I was on a side trail called Bear Ridge Trail, leading to Vermilion Valley Resort (VVR). I even started hiking back, but I really didn\u2019t want to go back these past two miles, so I continued towards VVR.

I woke up around 6am took a shower because why not? And had warm breakfast and coffee at the hotel. When I couldn\u2019t eat anymore, I packed my stuff (I think it\u2019s the heaviest my backpack has ever been), called my beautiful German family \ud83d\udc9c and lazily went to the bus stop to take a trolley to the ski station and from there take a bus back to where I left the trail yesterday.\n\nTo my surprise, as soon as I got off the bus I saw Tangent seating on a picnic table having breakfast. He was clear happy and surprised to see me! He told me that Geezer was really scared about what could have happened to me because I disappeared. He explained that Bullfrog and Geezer returned to trail yesterday but he still needs to go back to Mammoth to grab a package at the post office (he couldn\u2019t do it today nor yesterday: weekend).\n\nI stayed talking to Tangent and Rocky (a guy from Lithuania \ud83c\uddf1\ud83c\uddf9 who hikes in flip-flops \ud83e\ude74 and brings a ukulele on top of his gigantic backpack) for an hour or so and started my hiking day around 11:30.\n\nThere\u2019s another broken bridge on the PCT so I had to do this tiny reroute. For about 3-4 miles I hiked a bit of the Rainbow Falls Trail then Devil\u2019s Postpile Trail and also a bit of road walk. Both trails were packed with tourists and day hikers: the trails, parking, amenities and campgrounds in this area opened two days ago. I think it\u2019s super cool that people from all ages and backgrounds go out for day hikes like this. Hiking such a pleasurable way of spending time \ud83d\ude0a!\n\nAround 1pm I was back at the PCT. I kept hiking for 12 more miles and found a campsite only after 7pm. I saw quite a few new people on the PCT today (around 6-8 people). I was in a good mood and I felt super motivated the whole day. The hike itself was also good: very little snow and dry feet!\n\nThere were some incredible views today, including from where I\u2019m camping tonight. This place is unbelievable \ud83e\udd29!\n\nI have the ambitious plan to do two passes tomorrow morning. The first (Island Pass) should be fairly easy but the second should be a bit challenging. It\u2019s the Donohue Pass. After crossing it, I\u2019ll be hiking for a few days on the Yosemite National Park \ud83c\udfde\ufe0f!

The fact that the temperature during the night has not been going down below freezing isn\u2019t going to help: from the moment I started hiking around 6am, the snow was already slushy.\n\nThe first pass (Island Pass) was the easiest pass so far. You barely notice that it\u2019s a pass. It was quite tiring though because of all the slushy snow. After that, I \u201crushed\u201d to the next pass: it took me around 5 hours to hike 6 miles, but I finally reached the Donohue Pass late in the afternoon! Lots of slushy snow and no need for any snow gear. Going over Donohue Pass means that now I am in the Yosemite National Park \ud83c\udfde\ufe0f!\n\nIt\u2019s funny how things become normal. Wearing wet shoes in the morning (good thing they don\u2019t freeze anymore), crossing rivers knee-deep with a 15kg backpack, stopping during the day to dry your tent and sleeping bag. Today I have the feeling that I could keep hiking forever!\n\nHappy with my two passes achievement, I stopped early in the day, around 4:20pm. I cooked dinner and did all my chores earlier than normal and now it\u2019s 5:40pm. I\u2019ll have some rare spare time between writing Polarsteps and going to bed!\n\nWhen I was cooking dinner, two very polite park rangers came by to check my PCT permit.

This wasn\u2019t the first time during the PCT that after finishing the day early, I just fall completely asleep. I don\u2019t even remember, but I probably fell asleep around 6:30-7:00pm and had an uninterrupted and deep sleep until 6am. I woke up feeling refreshed!\n\nDuring the day I met a few day hikers. The Yosemite National Park is very inviting for all types of hikers and the hiking season has just started. One lady came to me and randomly asked: how many blisters did you have already? I replied \u201cthree\u201d. She mumbled \u201cgood for you\u201d and walked away. Go figure\u2026 but at least this made me realize that my right knee and achilles aren\u2019t hurting anymore. After my good night of sleep, I feel like I am 100%!\n\nThe first half of the day was a walk in the park. Besides the fact that the trail was very wet (I\u2019m used to wet feet already), it was flat and chill. I was happily enjoying my lunch at noon after having hiked 12 miles already.\n\nThe afternoon was a little bit more demanding, but not too much. There was some elevation, but the snow was very scarce. It seems that the snow has been melting for a while here in Yosemite. This is good because it\u2019s much easier (and faster) to hike without snow (as opposed as slushy snow) and the level of the water crossings are not so strong as they were one week ago (by reading the reports of other hikers on the app we use during the PCT). This is good, because today I had two mid-thigh high crossings. Not necessarily scary, but very wet and cold. I wouldn\u2019t want these crossings to be waist or chest high.\n\nThe bad thing about the snow melting are the mosquitos \ud83e\udd9f. Today was the first time that I had to: 1) hike wearing my rain pants and wind jacket to protect me from the mosquitos (it was 30\u00b0C); 2) wore my head net for hiking and for setting camp; 3) ate dinner inside my tent (which is not recommended \ud83d\udc3b), because it\u2019s just impossible to eat outside. I wonder how I am going to do number two with all these mosquitos lurking around \ud83c\udf51\ud83e\udd9f! \n\nAt the end of the day I managed to hike a marathon \u2014 it had been a while since the last time!

Otherwise it would be a very short day.\n\nThere\u2019s much, much less snow here at Yosemite than before Donohue Pass (where I entered Yosemite National Park). Less snow means that the passes are less challenging (no snow gear, following the trail instead of random footpaths) but as tiring as before.\n\nI was happy to be at the top of Benson Pass before 9am. It was a steep ascend with a lot of switchbacks and not too much snow. I had breakfast (chocolate electronola) at the top of the pass.\n\nThen it came the descent. It took me almost forever (3-4 hours) to go down. It was as steep as the ascent, but with much more snow, ice and wet (slippery) ground. It was a patience game to slowly go down the mountain. My knees were not very happy at the end of the descent.\n\nI was a bit demotivated. It took be too long to completely do the first pass and at lunch I spend some time thinking about a plan B. Maybe I could at least go to the top of the second pass and camp there? That sounded like an ok idea.\n\nAfter my lunch break, around 2pm, I started ascending Seavey Pass. Steep, but almost snow-free. Soon after I started ascending I hear someone behind me yelling \u201cBruno!\u201d. I turn back it\u2019s Bullfrog (!!) with another hiker, Rambo. \u201cHey Bullfrog, it\u2019s good to see you!\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you too but  god I hate these bloody mosquitoes!\u201d he replies. Yeah, me too.\n\nIt\u2019s about 3:30 when we reach the top of the pass. It\u2019s was not difficult, but very exhausting. Bullfrog and Rambo decided to camp on the top of the pass to avoid mosquitoes (higher altitude = less mosquitoes). Since it was a bit early, I decided to go down the mountain and see how much I could still hike today.\n\nAfter going down the pass and hiking a total of 17km, there was a waist-height crossing with quite a strong current. After taking some time to find a good spot to cross (I had to hike a few minutes upstream), I found a better place (but just barely). Full concentration mode and after a nerve-wrecking cross, I was on the other side of the stream! I decided to call it a day!

Every morning I make sure that everything fits in the dry sack properly and that the dry sack is properly closed. After 58 days hiking, today was the first day that I was very thankful for my own discipline. I\u2019ll get there soon (spoiler alert: it rained).\n\nIt was not so cold, so I slept with one of the doors of the tent open (but with the net, of course). It\u2019s so cool to wake up at night, open your eyes and see the most starry sky \ud83c\udf0c! That\u2019s for sure one of my favorite things about camping!\n\nI had an ambitious plan for today: make it through the loooong ascend to Dorothy Lake Pass (and leave Yosemite) and go down to get as close as possible to Sonora Pass, where I can go to town, hopefully tomorrow. This would be awesome because I would arrive in town one day earlier than I planned and could take a nice (and well deserved!) zero. But that also meant a 24 miles day.\n\nThe day started well. The deer family was still around in the morning and I was in good mood so I started the day hiking a bit faster, trying to push a bit on the ascend to Dorothy Lake Pass. It was very wet and swampy and my feet stayed wet for the whole day. It\u2019s actually kind of liberating when you realize that there\u2019s no other way, so you should just accept that you can freely step in water or mud.\n\nMosquitoes surrounded me at all times. In the morning I had to hike with rain pants, wind jacket and the head net. It was suffocating to hike on my own portable sauna, but it\u2019s just maddening otherwise. For three times I tried to take a break but it\u2019s just impossible to enjoy, so I kept hiking without a break for 14 miles. I could only stop to have breakfast+lunch at 1pm, having started at 6. I was starving.\n\nGood thing is that it made a very productive morning, although I still needed to hike up three more miles to go over the pass and descend for seven miles to the campsite.\n\nAt 3pm I made it to the top. There was very little snow (but a lot of water). By the way, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll need my snow gear anymore. I\u2019ll probably mail them back next week.\n\nCrossing the pass, I was in a tight but possible schedule. I was hoping for little snow on the other side as well. What I was not really expecting was rain. And hail.\n\nI still had to hike for 7 miles, which usually takes me 3-4 hours, depending on the trail. As soon as it started raining I wore my rain jacket (for the first time!) and exhaled relieved as I remembered that my things were protected from the rain in my backpack. A few minutes after the rain, it started to hail. The mix of rain and hail lasted for about one hour. For the first mile or so (~30 min), there was a bit of snow, but then the trail became snow-free. I was a bit scared when it started raining but I checked the forecast and the sky should clear up tonight still. I just wanted to arrive at camp,\nso I hiked fast. In the end, the rain didn\u2019t bother me that much.\n\nI arrived at camp before 6pm (!), so I had plenty of time. Unfortunately the rain became a bit heavier while I was setting up my tent and everything got wet inside. Right after it stopped raining I opened the doors and let the air circulate to dry the tent a bit and since all my sleeping stuff are super dry, it\u2019s all good!\n\nCurrently it\u2019s not possible to enjoy the camp. It\u2019s unbelievable the amount of mosquitoes and how they\u2019re really hungry! Since yesterday, the first thing to do when arriving at camp is to wear the anti-mosquito clothes (pants, jacket, net). Only then you can proceed with the other chores.\n\nTomorrow I have a relatively short day (12.5 miles) to arrive in town! The two problems are: first, it\u2019s a big ascend (~2300ft/700m) up to almost 11000ft/3350m. Hopefully there won\u2019t be a lot of snow to slow me down. Second, all my things are wet.

It wasn\u2019t necessarily bad, but not too good either.\n\nAlmost everything was wet. Me and my sleeping system were dry, that was it. It was chilly and windy and it was a bit tough to pack everything, specially the tent. My gloves, which I store on one of the hip belt pockets, were also wet. My socks were wet. On top of all the wetness, my hiking shirt (also wet) is falling apart. For the first time I hiked with something else instead of it: my fleece. I don\u2019t think I can use my hiking shirt anymore.\n\nI knew the day was going to be short, but with a big ascend to almost 11000 feet. The ascend was fine, almost snow free. The trail was a bit slippery and there was a thin layer of ice on top of the snow and rocks. And there were a lot of rocks: these mountains are covered by volcanic rocks, which aren\u2019t the best thing to hike on. \n\nDescending, as usual, was tougher than going up. The fact that I forgot to check for water sources and had to hike 8 miles without drinking only made it worse (I\u2019m so used to have water whenever you want here in the Sierra).\n\nBut I had enough time and knew that I was going in the direction of taking a zero tomorrow. So I took my time and tried to enjoy the descent and glissaded twice (one intentionally and the other by accident)! There was also a sketchy part where I had to kick in footholds on the softening snow to be able to traverse a small cliff. Joys of hiking on snow.\n\nFrom the descent I could see the highway \ud83d\udee3\ufe0f. That helped me to give the final push and before 2pm I was at the road. I knew there would be a shuttle that brings PCT hikers to Kennedy Meadows North (a resupply, dining and lodging place, 8 miles from the trailhead). While I waited I saw Rambo coming down the mountain. We chatted a bit and he told me that he knew it was me that made the footholds and thanked me for them!

Besides all the facilities (internet, laundry, showers, etc) there\u2019s also a very convenient store, a restaurant and a saloon (a bar?). They offer free shuttles to and from the trailhead. It\u2019s also kind of a farm. There are horses and cows. Everything is run by generators. At 11pm they shut everything down and turn back on at 5:30am.\n\nIt\u2019s perfect place for a zero.

The big passes are behind me and hopefully the big snow too!\n\nIt\u2019s always amazing to wake up and have warm breakfast and coffee. For the second day in a row, I had pancakes \ud83e\udd5e, hash brown, eggs \ud83c\udf73 and unlimited coffee. When I finished my plate, somebody from the store gave ice cream to all hikers. I was so full and very glad that I still had more than two hours before the shuttle would leave to the trailhead so I could digest all the food.\n\nAfter getting rid of a lot of stuff (snow gear, extra clothes, etc), my backpack is much lighter and compact. Usually when I leave town I carry food for 6-8 days. This time I have food for four, which makes the load even lighter. I started hiking at 10:30 and kept hiking in almost one go for 7 hours. I only stopped to filter water. Rambo went ahead and I hiked with Bullfrog for a while. We ended up all finding spots to camp a little bit far from each other, so I\u2019m camping alone tonight (and without mosquitoes!!!).\n\nDuring the past two days I saw probably another 20 PCT hikers. I don\u2019t know where these people were before, but it was nice to see new faces. The shuttle to the trailhead was full (10 people) and I quickly chatted with some of the hikers during the day.\n\nThe hike itself was super chill today. A few snow patches here and there and no wet feet!

It took me a while to gather the strength to leave the warmth of the sleeping bag and start packing. I left camp at 7am.\n\nAround 10am I met Bullfrog on trail. He had an early start so he was ahead of me. He was having breakfast so I moved on.\n\nEven though it was sunny, there was a chilly wind blowing during the whole day. The trail was quite pleasant, with not many snow patches or sketchy parts. I took my time to hike and camped early, at 5pm. Around 6pm Bullfrog showed up and set his tent here as well!

I woke up super warm and I was surprised when I saw that it was -6\u00b0C! Apparently wearing all my clothes can really keep me warm.\n\nWhen I left my tent I saw that Bullfrog had re-started the fire. He was boiling water for his every morning tea. He\u2019s English.\n\nUsually I don\u2019t eat breakfast when I wake up. I prefer to have it after a few hours hiking. But a campfire is for sure a good reason to have break this rule, so after I packed up I joined Bullfrog for half an hour or so and had my chocolate electronola. I started hiking around 6:30 and Bullfrog stayed, enjoying the fire.\n\nThe day was chilly but less windy. I don\u2019t know if I already told this, but I\u2019m hiking wearing my fleece because my sun hoodie (hiking shirt) was so full of holes that I had to throw it away. In the end it\u2019s been very convenient because the past three days have been quite cold.\n\nI knew from the beginning that today I would do 20 miles (and 19 tomorrow), so I took my time and hiked at a chill pace. Twenty miles shouldn\u2019t be that difficult. And it wasn\u2019t. The day passed by and I had a very pleasant hiking day.\n\nOne thing they have been missing (thank god) for a few days already are the mosquitoes. I really really really hope it stays like that.\n\nI arrived at camp before 4pm and had time to chill and do everything slowly, which is always good. Bullfrog just arrived (it\u2019s 6:15pm now).

I started hiking before 5:30 and could watch a beautiful sunrise. For the last pass of the Sierra section (Carson Pass), I was a bit afraid to have to deal with too much snow/ice but there was only a bit of snow and it was frozen solid (it\u2019s been cold for the past three days). The descent also came without surprises and before 8am we were having cookies, brownies, fruit and soda. Trail Magic \ud83e\ude84!\n\nThey had watermelons and grapes so I stayed more than I should have. At that point, the only food I had with me was 2 portions of electronola. I was very happy to have a more enjoyable breakfast.\n\nIt was a quite uneventful hike after that. I saw some day hikers along the trail, went a bit up and down in elevation, crossed some streams. After I reached 17 miles I had the chance to hitch to South Lake Tahoe but I didn\u2019t want to hitch on the highway so I kept going to Echo Lake. There, I would need to ask for a ride on the parking lot, which I prefer. But before that I had milkshake and chips \u2014 I was starving!\n\nAnd all of a sudden, the Sierra is over! It was quite an experience to hike and camp in such high elevation. Lots of challenges and good memories but I\u2019m glad it\u2019s past now!

I asked if any of them was going to South Lake Tahoe. Nope.\n\nThey suggested me what I was already considering: going *back* 1.4 miles to the highway and hitch there. On the road, almost all cars are going to South Lake Tahoe so in theory it would be easier to hitch there. At the parking lot, people could be going anywhere. Another possibility would be to be persistent at the parking lot. Eventually I would get a ride, one of the men said.\n\nWhere are you from? The older man asked. He was unloading some construction material from a very old and beaten truck. I am from Brazil, I replied. \u201cOh, voc\u00ea fala Portugu\u00eas? Vamos conversar!\u201d he said back!\n\nThe man, Christopher, invited me to his cabin and I also met his son, Julian, mid-20s who had just finished his studies in Barcelona. They were there for a few days to repair some things in the cabin and enjoy some mountain biking.\n\nWe talked for almost two hours. Christopher explained me that he started studying Brazilian Portuguese because he likes the language and he was clearly trying his best to speak correct Portuguese and not Spanish (he\u2019s studying Spanish at the moment) and it was super cool to see an American putting so much effort into learning foreign languages. Not something you see everyday.\n\nChristopher then said that he would gladly give me a ride to town! He just needed to finish unloading the truck and soon after we were on our way to South Lake Tahoe. Since it was still before 5pm, I decided to go to the car rental company and see if I could get a car today already (I have a reservation for tomorrow). If that worked out, instead of sleeping one night in South Lake Tahoe I would drive  ~5 hours to San Jose and sleep at my friend\u2019s place. (I\u2019m having a quad-zero, more on that in a future post!)\n\nLong story short, I couldn\u2019t rent a car because my driver\u2019s license is dutch and I don\u2019t have an \u201cinternational driver\u2019s license\u201d \ud83e\udeaa. The guy said he would even cancel my reservation since I wouldn\u2019t be able to rent the car tomorrow as well.\n\nThat would completely ruin my plan. I googled other car rental companies and nothing. But then there was an ad for this app, Turo, in which you can rent other people\u2019s cars. I downloaded it, found one single car available in the whole region, called the owner to make sure everything was set and it turned out that I could have the car within one hour! I just needed to find a way to get to the car, 4 miles away. No way I would walk four more miles today!\n\nI saw some Lime/Byrd scooters \ud83d\udef4 on the sidewalk. I stopped by one, opened the Byrd app, read the QR-code and the scooter unlocked! HIkertrash with a PCT backpack riding a scooter in South Lake Tahoe!\n\nEverything went well with the car and by 6:30pm I was already driving to San Jose.

And a lot of bites from mosquitoes \ud83e\udd72.\n\nAs we continue our tradition of making wise decisions, we took our time to enjoy the day today and finished the day at 11 miles, which is exactly what we had planned: our goal \ud83e\udd45 is to arrive in Truckee by the end of Friday and therefore we need to do an average of 12 miles per day \u2705!\n\nTonight we\u2019re camping close to another beautiful lake (Lake Gilmore) and Maike already got into the hiker\u2019s sleeping schedule: it\u2019s 8pm and she\u2019s been sleeping for half an hour already \ud83d\ude34.", "slug": "south-lake-tahoe", "display_slug": "south-lake-tahoe", "type": 1, "start_time": 1719283524.324165, "end_time": null, "creation_time": 1719283541.472612, "location": {"id": 134217406, "name": "South Lake Tahoe", "detail": "USA", "full_detail": "California, USA", "country_code": "US", "lat": 38.892244538328505, "lon": -120.1148294472323, "venue": null, "uuid": "D3666948-032A-4BA1-B081-BD26E46035BB"}, "supertype": "normal", "is_deleted": false, "open_graph_id": null, "fb_publish_status": null, "timezone_id": "America/Los_Angeles", "views": 0, "comment_count": 1, "weather_condition": "clear-day", "weather_temperature": 27.0, "uuid": "87EEB697-1C83-4E37-B010-CCF5E00C94BD"}, {"id": 108653683, "trip_id": 10158283, "location_id": 134219390, "main_media_item_path": null, "name": "Mosquitofest \ud83e\ude78\ud83e\udd9f", "display_name": "Mosquitofest \ud83e\ude78\ud83e\udd9f", "description": "Day 70\nMile 1104.5 to mile 1116.3\nPCT Miles: 11.8 (18.9km)\nTotal Miles: 1116.3 (1786.1km)\n\nAfter a long night of good sleep we woke up to even more mosquitoes than the evening before. I am so glad that I don\u2019t need to expose my butt to pee like other people here \ud83e\udd2d.\n\nHead net, wind jacket and rain pants on, we started hiking immediately. No breakfast, no brushing our teeth \ud83e\udd22.\n\nThe morning was a bit cloudy and we started the day going up a pass (Dick\u2019s Pass). I was a little bit concerned about the pass because I read some reports that there would be a lot of snow there, specially during the descent. We were happy to be able to hike our own alternative route and with some zigzagging and bushwhacking we avoided most of the left over snow patches. Before that, at the pass, I introduced Maike to electronola and it was approved by her \ud83d\udc4d!\n\nToday we also had a more challenging stream crossing. We almost decided to cross via the stream itself but at the end we did some log and rock \ud83e\udeb5\ud83e\udea8  hopping and ended our second day with dry feet \ud83e\uddb6!\n\nThe downside of today were the mosquitoes. It was a plague. Miserable little creatures sent by the devil. We developed a few strategies to escape from them. The best being to keep moving all the time, even when we were taking breaks. Eating, drinking water or simply resting becomes a torture. You cannot ever stop moving. We had the company of these tiny bastards during our entire day. At the end of the day we were completely exhausted since we couldn\u2019t take proper breaks.

For the first four hours of the day we hiked wearing our rain clothes plus the head net. Thankfully it was a bit cloudy so it was not that bad, warmth wise (definitely not that good either). Not being able to have proper breaks and the lack of prospect for any improvements on the mosquitoes situation really put both my and Maike\u2019s mood down.\n\nMileage-wise, we had our best morning so far: by 10am we had covered half of what we had planned for today (7 out of 14 miles). We were still annoyed by the mosquitoes though. \n\nAll of a sudden, around 11am, we noticed that the amount of mosquitoes started to drop. At some point, Maike gave a leap of faith and removed all her mosquito protection. I did the same and for our positive surprise, the mosquitoes were almost gone indeed. The hike in the afternoon was much more pleasant, with high morale and low mosquitoes. And since we were ahead of schedule, we took longer mosquitoless breaks.\n\nAbout 2 miles off to finish our day we had a quick break to drink water. Something caught my attention down in the valley and I saw something moving. Sure that it was a deer, I kept looking until I could see without a shade of doubt: I was looking at a black bear. \u201cOh my god it\u2019s a bear\u201d I said to Maike. She turned around and confirmed. Both me and Maike were seeing a bear in nature for the first time. \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d. \u201cLet\u2019s make noise and keep going\u201d.\n\nAs soon as we started to clang our hiking poles together and Maike started singing, the bear (which we named Hera) ran away to the opposite direction. We kept hiking and singing steadily for the next 2 miles until we reached our campground for tonight. We were hoping to meet more people but the campground (that has space for about 5-6 tents) was empty. We started to pitch our tents and do our chores.\n\nNo more than half an hour later, we were both relieved to see that two other hikers arrived to camp here. When Maike was taking to one of them, he asked \u201cis that Bruno?\u201d. It was Pete, one of the hikers that arrived was part of the first group of people that I hiked together with on my very first day!

By the time we woke up though (around 6:30) almost everybody was gone. We decided to enjoy the mosquitoless morning and have breakfast before we started hiking. I had classic chocolate electronola and Maike had peanut butter overload: peanut butter granola, crunchy peanut butter and, instead of milk or yoghurt, it\u2019s soaked in powdered peanut butter (plus water).\n\nWhen we were about to leave camp, one hiker passed by and I recognized him: It was Rocky (the Lithuanian guy that I mentioned on Day 54)! It was so good to see a familiar face! Rocky is such a character: he was over the moon because a trail angel had gifted him hiking shoes (he was hiking on sandals and flip flops before) and he updated us about my ex hiker companions: Bullfrog was still taking zeroes in South Lake Tahoe, Geezer was 3-4 days ahead and Tangent was off trail attending two weddings but would come back. Rocky\u2019s good mood was contagious and we left camp with our spirits elevated!\n\nIt was a chilly and very windy morning. We started hiking over a ridge and over some ski areas. It\u2019s very interesting to see how the mountains where people ski during winter look like without all the snow. Talking about snow, we had some today but we managed everything just fine.\n\nDuring our second break of the day another hiker passed by and once more I recognized him: it was Fizz! (I met him on day 42 and hiked with him for a few days in the Sierra). We chatted a bit about the past days. As always he was in good mood, saying that he was having a great time and that this is what the PCT is about: to enjoy and have fun. He always states that he will leave the PCT as soon as he stops enjoying and have fun everyday and he\u2019s still here \ud83d\ude0a. For me it was super cool to see Fizz (and Rocky) again and introduce them to Maike!\n\nWe decided to do a longer day today and hike almost 17 miles, so we can hike less tomorrow and arrive in Truckee earlier. Everything went fine until the last two miles. The wind started blowing really hard on the last steep ascend of the day (1.5 miles) and literally on the last 0.5 miles until campground, which was a ridge (a narrow path where you have a cliff on both sides). It was a bit nerve wracking to keep the balance against the strong wind (specially for Maike who called it \u201cthe ridge of horror\u201c) but we made camp safe and sound. We pitched our tent, made dinner and enjoyed a beautiful sunset. There were no mosquitoes during the whole day, but the wind outside is still strong so we were happy to be warm on our tents as soon as we could.\n\nIf everything goes well tomorrow we arrive in Truckee for lunch and we will meet our good friends Chris and Jessica who are coming from San Jose to spend the weekend with us \ud83e\udef6!", "slug": "truckee", "display_slug": "truckee", "type": 1, "start_time": 1719544470.517125, "end_time": null, "creation_time": 1719544607.700375, "location": {"id": 134231846, "name": "Truckee", "detail": "USA", "full_detail": "California, USA", "country_code": "US", "lat": 39.253709795921345, "lon": -120.29122064832625, "venue": null, "uuid": "EAD6631C-2DD4-40C1-AAF8-B27812BC77CF"}, "supertype": "normal", "is_deleted": false, "open_graph_id": null, "fb_publish_status": null, "timezone_id": "America/Los_Angeles", "views": 0, "comment_count": 4, "weather_condition": "clear-day", "weather_temperature": 26.0, "uuid": "735E08A8-57BC-40F3-A197-9B71B2C66DEB"}, {"id": 108885903, "trip_id": 10158283, "location_id": 134514694, "main_media_item_path": null, "name": "Into Truckee", "display_name": "Into Truckee", "description": "Day 73\nMile 1147.7 to mile 1154.5\nPCT Miles: 6.8 (10.9km)\nTotal Miles: 1154.5 (1847.2km)\n\nKnowing that you have a short day into town ahead is a double-edged sword: it\u2019s supposedly a short day and you\u2019re motivated to arrive. At the same time, you know you can chill because there\u2019s usually no pressure. We took our time to hike the 7 miles today and enjoy the much less windy day.\n\nIn one of our shorts stops, I was taking some pictures on top of a rock when I saw another hiker approaching. After a few seconds I recognized her: it was Clara (literally the only person on the PCT that I knew before starting the hike! We started together in Campo and saw each other for the last time in Idyllwild on day 10)!!!\n\nIt was so good to see her! She\u2019s still going strong and said she\u2019s now crushing more and more miles everyday and has a target date to finish the PCT: September 6th! She was hiking with Haribo and after a quick heads up she kept hiking on. We wanted to meet her in Truckee later for a coffee  but unfortunately orur hitchhiking schedule didn\u2019t help and we weren\u2019t able to see her again. Somehow I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll see her on trail again! Happy trails, Clara!\n\nThe trail this morning was fine, with some snow patches here and there, but nothing sketchy. We crossed paths with quite a few day hikers and chatted with most of them, as our mood was elevated. The highlight of the short day was to hike through a ski station! It\u2019s so interesting to see ski lifts, gondolas and the pistes themselves all without snow. We actually went down (waking) one stretch of a blue piste!\n\nWe were a bit hungry when we arrived at the parking lot where we should try to hitch, so we sat down and started to eat some of our snacks and observe the movement. Hitching on a trailhead parking lot should be relatively easy: there\u2019s not a lot of \u201ctraffic\u201d but people are usually friendly and willing to give a hike to the next town after they had a pleasant hike themselves and are usually in good mood.\n\nWhile still munching our food, we saw two guys coming back from the trail to their cars. They had no backpacks and seemed pretty chill. For a split second I thought about letting the laziness take control and ignore them, but I was looking forward to a breakfast burrito, so I went to them and asked \u201chey good morning. Are you guys by any chance going to Truckee? Could you give us a ride?\u201d Double yes as an answer and we had a ride on our first try!!\n\nThey were Dion and Nick, from Australia and New Zealand, and they\u2019re in the US traveling around and visiting some nice spots. They were staying in Truckee for the night so it wasn\u2019t a problem at all first them to bring us. We talked a bit about hiking and the PCT and in 20 minutes we were in town, ready to devour our food and cold drinks!\n\nAfter lunch we had another mission: find a way to go to our Airbnb which was in a ski resort, 12 miles away. Google Maps told us they there should be a bus that could bring us somewhere nearby our place. We walked a bit to the bus stop \ud83d\ude8f and literally one minute later a car stopped for us \u201chey, do you guys want a ride?\u201d. We couldn\u2019t believe our eyes and ears!\n\nDave, the driver, was a local who also hikes and has hiked the PCT. He said he understands how helpful these rides are and that he always tries to give rides when he can. We talked a bit about hiking (as always) but also music and Europe. It was a pleasant 20 minutes hike to our Airbnb.\n\nWe had to wait a bit outside for our checkin time but afterwards everything went well: the wonders of flush toilet and a warm shower cannot be stated enough! It was our first shower since Sunday! Maike seemed really impressed with the dirtiness of her feet \ud83d\ude06.\n\nFor the rest of the day we chilled, of course. We finally had time to catch up with everything online, listen to some music and do nothing.

Today sounded like the perfect day to do so! Of course Maike, Chris and Jessica were onboard!\n\nHere was our plan: yesterday we bought some cookies \ud83c\udf6a , gatorades and fresh fruits (\ud83c\udf4e, \ud83c\udf4c, \ud83c\udf52, \ud83c\udf47) to bring today to the same trailhead where me and Maike finished our section together last Friday. The idea was to stay there and offer a refreshment to any PCT hiker that showed up on the parking lot.\n\nSo, after we checked out we drove to the trailhead\u2019s parking lot, put all the food on a wood bench that we found and waited there for hikers. We stayed for a few minutes and nobody showed up. We had agreed that we would spend maybe 1-2 hours there and I was hoping to see at least 4-5 hikers in this timeframe.\n\nI was feeling a little bit frustrated to see nobody so I decided to walk a bit to the actual trail and see if I could find someone coming. And then I saw something that I was not expecting at all!\n\nA few meters down the road, I saw a couple setting up this gazebo, like if they were setting up a small gathering area. As soon as they saw me, the woman excitedly asked me: are you a PCT hiker? \n\nIt turned out that this couple were hikers from the Class of 2021 and they lived close to the trail nowadays and they do some trail magic every now and then. They were setting up this space this morning with shade, chairs, drinks and making hot dogs for the thru-hikers! I explained my situation (that I\u2019m indeed a PCT thru-hiker but I was taking a week off and that I was there with my friends to do some trail magic ourselves as well). Can we all join you guys? I asked. OF COURSE they replied in unison and a few moments later we brought our things and combined our trail magic together!\n\nWe stayed for probably two hours and had an absolutely great time. We met Pain Perdu and her boyfriend, Space Case, Sharkbait, Rosie, Koda (a czech girl that I met at Scout and Frodo, before I started the PCT!), Hel\u00e8ne, Cashew (one of the dogs) and more people that I don\u2019t remember the names. It felt so good to be able to give a little back to my fellow hikers. We left the place with our spirits elevated and empty coolers! We super happy that everything went better than we planned!\n\nBefore driving back to San Jose we chilled a bit at the Doner River\u2019s riverside. I was feeling over the moon with this amazing experience that we had today!\n\nTomorrow me and Maike will be going to San Francisco to be tourists for a few days. The plan is for her to drive me back next saturday to the same trailhead of today so I can continue my hike keeping a continuous foot path).

So, this is exactly how the morning started!\n\nAfter having a slow breakfast, we packed our tiny and light bags (no food carry, no sleeping bags, no bear canister!) and went to the station to get our train to San Francisco. One and a half hour later, we arrived (it\u2019s crazy how cars and trains are faster than walking\u2026).\n\nWe were able to check in early at our hostel, which is always good.

Today, unfortunately, was one of them. Our plan was to pick up a car that we rented from someone using an app at 7am, so we woke up at 5:30 to finish packing. From there we would drive to Truckee and arrive before 2pm to post my resupply package before I restarted from the trailhead me and Maike ended at two weeks ago. From there Maike would return her rented bear canister in South Lake Tahoe and return to San Jose in the afternoon. \n\nThis was the actual course of events:\n\nWe woke up, finished packing and said goodbye to our hosts. We took an Uber to pick-up the car (carrying all our stuff) and were there at 7am sharp. We waited for one hour and nobody showed up, so we canceled the car. Jessica picked us up and we went to a rental car company (in the meanwhile I reserved one car online to speed up the process). The guy behind the counter said that he was cancelling all the reservations for today because they had no cars available \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f . It was already 11am and we were still in San Jose (and it was getting warmer).\n\nWe tried the app one more time. The only car available was a Fiat 500 with a pick-up time at 4pm. We booked and called the owner to ask if we could do an early pick up. He said we could pick the car up in one hour, so we went to the Post Office in San Jose to send my resupply box (that I will hopefully receive in 9 days) and from there to pick-up the 500. Everything went smoothly and we finally had a car! Time to drive east and think about the plan B, since it was too late to restart the PCT today still.\n\nNew plan: we drive to South Lake Tahoe, deliver the bear canister somehow (the place where we rented closed at 4, we would arrive around 7), sleep somewhere in SLT (because Truckee is too expensive and it would be too much to drive today) and tomorrow early morning we drive ~1h30min to the trailhead.\n\nOn our way to SLT we saw smoke from a fire in a forest close by. I counted at least 5 airplanes/helicopters carrying buckets of water to control the fire. I\u2019m not necessarily excited to be hiking into the wildfire season now. Today was the fourth day in a row with temperatures over 35\u00b0C. Our 500 was also struggling to keep the air inside cool while going up more than 7000ft in elevation gain.\n\nSince we couldn\u2019t actually return the bear canister, we hid it close to the ranger station (where we rented it) and tomorrow we\u2019ll give them a call to check if they found it. From there we had a quick drive to our hotel (that we booked on our way here) and tomorrow we\u2019re trying to leave to the trailhead at 7 and restart the bike at 9 or 10 latest.

We started driving a bit before 8am and at 10:30 I was saying goodbye to Maike and taking my first steps on the PCT since more than a week. It felt a bit bittersweet... I had an amazing time with Maike, both on trail and on my time off and to be very very honest I feel a bit demotivated with the PCT (and I blame the mosquitoes). But I have a plan to cheer me up.\n\nI want to finish the PCT as soon as I can. Starting tomorrow, I\u2019ll try to push a marathon per day. More than that, I will do longer stretches on trail before resupplying and I plan to take less zeroes. For this first stretch coming back to the PCT, I want to do 220 miles in 8.5 days. I started today (20 miles down!) and I want (need) to arrive by Monday before the post office closes (4pm) to grab my resupply box \ud83d\udce6. Then, I want to go back to trail on the same day and start a new 9 days stretch. Let\u2019s see how this goes!\n\nThe first three or four hours hiking were very busy. It\u2019s Sunday and there were a lot of day hikers and climbers (!) on or around the trail. But slowly it started to become less common to see people and after 3pm I didn\u2019t see anybody for the rest of the day.\n\nAlthough it was warm, I enjoyed the hiking day. Unfortunately the mosquitoes did show up but they gave a break around dinner time, so it wasn\u2019t so bad. \n\nI must say that I\u2019m becoming a bit scared of the wildfires. Yesterday on our drive to South Lake Tahoe we saw from the car a fire on the mountains and just now, after setting up my tent and starting cooking dinner, I saw that there\u2019s a fire south from where I\u2019m camping. By the amount of smoke it seemed that it had just started but now (8:30pm) it\u2019s worse. The wind is blowing to the other side so I really believe there\u2019s no risk for me.

His name was Snakebite, he was 75 and he was from Japan! I had such a good chat with him (some in English some in Japanese), talking about the Shikoku Pilgrimage that I did with Maike last year). I made him cry when I said that I want to be genki like him when I\u2019m 75. Since he hikes in a slower pace, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to see Snakebite again. Ganbatte Snakebite-san!

I decided to try to get there before they closed (which I wrongly believed it was at 9pm). If I could get a meal and maybe some snacks, I would be more comfortable with the amount of food that I have until the next resupply.\n\nI hiked fast in the morning through a forest of dead trees, result of a wildfire a few years ago.

After liters of sweat, I finally make it to the top, where I had a big shade break at the water source there. I had to filter 6 liters of water, since I drank 4 liters in one go.\n\nThis was the moment that I realized that the resort/restaurant\u2019s closing time was 7pm (and not 9). It would be almost impossible to make it in time. I decided not to take the side trail there and keep hiking further. I\u2019ll figure out the food situation in another opportunity.\n\nAlong the way there were boxes with books for hikers! I miss reading so much, but I definitely don\u2019t have the time and energy at the moment. Good night \ud83e\udd71!\n\n(I bought a bag of savory nuts to mix with my granola.

It\u2019s located literally on the PCT and it looks tiny. Hopefully I would be able to buy a few snacks to top up my food for the coming 3 days.\n\nI went on auto-pilot and before 1:30pm I was in Belden Town. It\u2019s a street with 5 wooden houses and a big building containing a general store, a simple restaurant (!) and a hotel. Everybody is super hiker friendly and, most importantly, they had air conditioning!\n\nAfter eating a burger with fries and five beers* I resupplied with snickers and two gigantic packs of cookies.

The spring was very convenient \ud83d\ude0a.\n\nAround 12:30 the sun started to get really hot. I was halfway to a water spring (which was 15 minutes off trail) and I had just enough (lukewarm) water to make it to the spring. And then.\n\nTrail magic \ud83e\ude84!\n\nFree fresh food and cold drinks. Differently from the usual trail magic, there were no cliff bars or m&ms or junk food in general. There were actually a lot of homemade food! Potato salad, fruit salad, home baked cookies, muffins, sandwiches. Fresh fruit and vegetables from one of the trail angel\u2019s garden. All there absolutely for free for thru hikers to satisfy their hunger.

I\u2019m skipping this town (Chester) and instead I\u2019ll get (hopefully \ud83d\ude2c) my package that I sent to myself in the next town, Old Station!\n\nI had a wonderful lunch break by the river. I knew I would have a \u201cshort\u201d day today (around 23 miles) so took my time and soaked my feet in the cold water and scrubbed the dirt and all the ash off. My socks were so dirty and full of salt from feet sweat that they were stiff. It was actually hurting a bit as if I was wearing wooden socks. I vigorously washed them (in this heat and sun, they dried up in 20 minutes) and spent two hours chilling and eating my last portion of disgusting olivranola.

Now I had what to do until the general store opened (at 9). The post office opens at 11.\n\nThere was only one cliff bar left of all my food. I was starving (and very happy that my food lasted exactly what it needed to last). I was the first customer at the general store (and at the post office too).

They send this box to themselves from time to time and when they receive it (like now), they prepare the 2-3 next resupply boxes and send this big box further away and when they reach there, they repeat the process.

They\u2019re known to come at night to lick \ud83d\udc45 or chew on your trekking poles handles or backpack straps). I tried to send them away a few times but at some point I just gave up and sent back to sleep. My stuff seemed untouched in the morning.\n\nWhen I finally woke up I was a bit in bad mood. My Garmin was acting a bit weird and I was anxious about the fire ahead: the only info I had was from this random girl at the trail magic two days ago who told me that the PCT would be closed earlier than we were expecting: at mile 1824, at the junction with the Crater Lake Rim Trail.\n\nInstructions were unclear, so I hiked fast in the morning. On the way I met Bilbo, English 26-years old dude. I had never seen him before. We hiked together for about one hour and we chatted during that time. Or, better said, Bilbo chatted with me. He told me about his life back in England, his time in the army, how he wanted to be deployed in Iraq during covid, his misfortunes with women and jobs and his aspirations to become a paramedic. He told me a lot.\n\nHe exited the trail earlier, afraid that the trail would be closed ahead and we would have to turn around and go back.\n\nThe trail was indeed closed at mile 1824.0 but I the alternative was to take the Crater Lake Rim Trail, which I did, arriving at the restaurant at Crater Lake Park parking lot at 11am. I was so looking forward for having breakfast AND lunch there. Unfortunately the kitchen was closed and I got fries with cheese and pre-packed salad \ud83d\ude10. I had free refills of tea and coffee though.\n\nI stayed there for three hours charging my devices, drinking 3 liters of tea and almost 2 of coffee, using the amazing miracle that are flush toilets \ud83d\udebd. Most importantly, I was trying to figure out a plan to go around the fire and arrive at Shelter Cove (80 miles ahead) tomorrow. My resupply package is there and I currently have less than one day of food.\n\nThe Rim Trail was actually very beautiful and enjoyable to hike for the first few miles. After that though the smoke started to thicken and I could feel the smoke on my sore eyes and throat. Not much I could do at this point, I kept hiking.\n\nIn the meanwhile I got a message from Free Mile, a hiker that I\u2019ve been leapfrogging with and to whom I talked to at the Crater Lake \u201cRestaurant\u201d. He said he had secured a ride for us tomorrow at noon from highway 138 (8 miles from where I\u2019m camping tonight) to Shelter Cove. Awesome!\n\nThe trail from tonight\u2019s campsite to highway 138 is actually closed, as part of the same closure from earlier today. To get there, we will do a 8 miles road walk, parallel to the PCT.\n\nArrived early at camp and the air quality here seems ok. On my way here I rationed my snacks and I only ate half of my dinner tonight, just in case. For tomorrow, until I get to Shelter Cove, I have half a dinner and three snack bars (which should be more than enough).", "slug": "crater-lake", "display_slug": "crater-lake", "type": 1, "start_time": 1722130772.329078, "end_time": null, "creation_time": 1722131451.099951, "location": {"id": 141649854, "name": "Crater Lake", "detail": "USA", "full_detail": "Oregon, USA", "country_code": "US", "lat": 42.99109929245244, "lon": -122.1303682868575, "venue": null, "uuid": "55DFB147-A1B8-4DB1-AE63-5E7EB6E8B62D"}, "supertype": "normal", "is_deleted": false, "open_graph_id": null, "fb_publish_status": null, "timezone_id": "America/Los_Angeles", "views": 0, "comment_count": 0, "weather_condition": "clear-day", "weather_temperature": 19.0, "uuid": "ADDA5139-4572-454F-B155-9B2CB17B9AAE"}, {"id": 115145088, "trip_id": 10158283, "location_id": 142567861, "main_media_item_path": null, "name": "Road walk", "display_name": "Road walk", "description": "Day 103, part 1\nMile 1840.3 to mile 1848.8\nPCT Miles: 8.5 (13.6km)\nTotal Miles: 1848.8 (2958.1km)\n\nThis past night I had one of the coldest night experiences here on the PCT.

It was a fairly steep uphill but I was fueled by the excitement to have unlimited fresh and warm food. I arrived at the lodge at 10:30 and had more than enough time to chill and charge my electronics.\n\nThe trail was packed with day hikers and tourists. To be honest, it seemed a very nice place to spend a Sunday or a weekend. There were so many families and people of all ages hiking, mountain biking, taking photographs and observing nature with binoculars. I\u2019m not sure all of them understood why some of the hikers (like me) looked so dirty and worn out \ud83d\ude43.\n\nAt 12 on the dot me with a group of other 6 hikers (only one, Andrew, that I already knew) sat on a table and started our little gluttony party. Again, I\u2019m sure our collective smelliness caught some undesired attention from non-thru hikers at the restaurant. On our table, there were piles of meat on the plates of the meat eaters. I had six plates two beers and two beers in front of me. Finally I feel moderately full!\n\nI was expecting a bit more of variety but honestly I can\u2019t complain. I had lots of fresh salad and vegetables, which is luxury on the PCT. I ended up spending five and a half hours at the lodge, charging, resting, calling Maike \ud83d\udc9c and I also left almost all my food on the hiker box.

I was more than happy to have set up my tent\u2019s rain fly again. All my gear (and myself) dry in the morning!\n\nAnother day on trail, another day of trail magic! This time it was just this guy who hiked the PCT a while ago and now he\u2019s retired and does trail magic in different parts of the PCT every year. He said his favorite part is when there\u2019s a heatwave and he brings ice cream to the hikers. They go crazy, he said.\n\nLots of fresh fruits and vegetables later, I continued my day. The plan was to get as close as I could from Cascade Locks, where I have my resupply package waiting for me. Hopefully I will be able to sort all my food for Washington and send 4-5 packages tomorrow still. If that works, I won\u2019t take a zero in Cascade Locks!\n\nThe highlight of the day and certainly one of the highlights of the whole trail was Tunnel Falls, on an alternate route that I had to take due a fire closure. This alternate (Eagle Creek Trail) is widely more used than the official PCT path for this section, because the Eagle Creek Trail is so scenic and you can see the Tunnel Falls, this majestic waterfall where you hike behind the falling water through a cold and dark tunnel. It\u2019s absolutely splendid.\n\nEarlier, still in the morning, I crossed paths with a girl who stopped me to ask if I was a PCT thru hiker. I said yes and then she told me that it\u2019s her dream: that one day she would also thru hike the PCT. She looked me in the eye and said \u201cThru hiking the PCT? it\u2019s a gift, dude.

I was able to arrive before the post office opened at 8:30am!\n\nI successfully got my packages containing 75% of all the food I\u2019ll need for the Washigton section. Two items that I was very looking forward were also in the boxes: flip flops and my stove!! Cold soaking never again!\n\nMy plan is to spend the day today sorting everything into small boxes and send four resupply packages ahead. All of that before the post office closes again, at 5am.\n\nOn top of that, I needed to take a 30 minutes bus to another town (Hood River) to buy socks and fleece pants (I\u2019m a bit afraid of getting too cold during the nights in Washington). To be able to plan things properly, I needed mind fuel. I stopped for a healthy breakfast before executing my plan: grilled cheese, fries and peanut butter milkshake.\n\nAfter eating, I needed a room to do all the resupply sorting so I went to the cheapest inn in town. I was able to get an affordable room and check in at 9:30am! Great! Now, the plan was to go to Hood River, buy the equipment and the rest of the food, pack at least the first two resupply boxes and send them today. And leave the other two packages to send tomorrow. The clock was ticking!\n\nMy search for socks and fleece pants was successful and so was the groceries run. At 4:30 I  was back at the post office in Cascade Locks just in time to send my boxes to the next two resupply towns: Trout Lake and White Pass! Check \u2705!\n\nOn the way back to the hotel from the post office I meet some not-so-happy-looking hikers. They quickly shared the news: in the past hour a new fire started, closing the trail from Trout Lake to White Pass. That\u2019s right: this new trail closure starts and ends literally where I had sent my packages to, just a few minutes ago.\n\nThe news completely destroyed my mood. I went to a brewery to have a burger (and my third portion of fries of the day) and a local non-alcoholic beer. After that I went back to the hotel and organized the last two boxes and don\u2019t even want to think about another re-route.

I had to decide what to do now. Physically, I was ready to start hiking. But I knew I couldn\u2019t start hiking without knowing more about the conditions ahead. Remember: 1) Don\u2019t die; and 2) Make wise decisions.\n\nI decided to take a zero. I booked the inn room for one more night and tried to slow down a little and analyze my options. I was (and am) feeling absolutely frustrated with these fire closures. Now, I have packages all over the place with food that I won\u2019t need and I have to find a way to retrieve them. Also, what am I going to do? Should I wait more? Should I take a bus to Portland and enjoy a few days off? Should I just skip the next 150 miles (I need to find a ride)?\n\nI spent the afternoon listening to music, podcasts, audio books, drinking beer (non-alcoholic) and doing absolutely nothing else.

Without any need of waking up early the next morning, I kept watching Olympic Games on the hotel\u2019s TV until way past hiker\u2019s midnight.\n\nI woke up and went to the same coffee shop that I went yesterday and had a breakfast burrito (I\u2019ll miss those!) and an iced latte. I was finishing my coffee when Clara showed up! I wasn\u2019t expecting her to arrive so early. It was so cool to see her and to be able to have a coffee together! Besides day 1, it\u2019s the third time that I meet Clara on trail! \ud83e\udef6\n\nWe, of course, discussed about the ultra recent William\u2019s Mine Fire closure. Apparently the best thing to do would be to skip around 150 miles and go straight to White Pass. Clara told me that she would stay at least one night in Cascade Locks and she would research alternative routes around the fire. She had no idea exactly how to do it, but she wanted to spend some time and energy (and maybe finding some help) to figure out an alternative. Fair enough.\n\nI told her that I was not very enthusiastic about the idea of finding alternative unofficial routes around a wildfire and I would, then, find my way to White Pass. I was in no rush, though. \n\nMost northbound hikers (like me) are taking the $10 bus to Portland, spending one night there and then finding a ride to White Pass. I decided that I would do the same, but I would spend more time in Portland.\n\nOk, so here is my plan \u2014 I told Clara \u2014 I\u2019ll go to Portland, buy a book and spend the weekend chilling and reading. And then next week I find a ride to White Pass and continue the hike. That\u2019s a good plan, she confirmed.\n\nSo we left the coffee shop to go meet her group at a restaurant 2 minutes away. As we cross the street somebody shouts: are you northbound hikers? Do you want a ride to White Pass?\n\nIn five seconds I changed my plans: yes! I replied. I couldn\u2019t refuse such an easy and unusual ride offer like this. To drive to White Pass you really need to go around the mountains (it\u2019s a 4 hours drive!). I told them (it was a guy and his mom) that I needed to still pack my stuff and check out from my room. No problem, they said. \u201cWe still have space for 3 more hikers, you\u2019re the first one\u201d. Great!\n\nClara shared her plans with them and they replied: \u201coh, yesterday we spend four hours working on this alternative route and we actually submitted a proposal to the PCTA to accept this route, since we believe it\u2019s pretty safe. Here\u2019s a printed map and a link to the file so you can download the route on your phone!\u201d.\n\nShe couldn\u2019t believe what she was listening! This is exactly what she wanted! We said our goodbyes and I rushed to pack and leave. The two trail angels spent almost one hour trying to find other hikers for the ride, but in the end they only found one more. Around noon we left Cascade Locks heading to White Pass!\n\nOn the way they explained that they, mother and son, live in Portland and are PCTA volunteers for that section of the PCT. They hiked the PCT together last year and this year they intended to do trail magic exactly at the part of the trail that was closed due this new fire, two days ago. They figured that the best way to help hikers then would be to use the day to give a ride north to White Pass to northbound hikers and on the way back give a ride to Cascade Locks to southbounders. It\u2019s a 4 hours drive each way.\n\nAfter three hours driving they offered to bring us not to White Pass, but a dozen miles south, closer to where the actual trail closure is. To get there, it would add more than one hour to the trip, driving on forest unpaved and unmaintained roads. That would be amazing, we replied. So that was the new plan!\n\nRight after we agreed on the new route, we saw two hikers hitching right ahead of us. The mom and son (I didn\u2019t ask their names!!) were over the moon to be able to help more hikers. They were clearly a bit unsatisfied driving with only two hikers. Now we were a full car!\n\nWhen we stopped on the road side and the hikers started loading their backpacks into the car when one of them suddenly asked \u201cBruno? Is that you?\u201d.\n\nIt was Pete (from days 1 and 71)! He and Nick (another guy who I saw a few times already) were actually on trail when it was closed and had to go back and had spent the whole day taking buses after buses to get to White Pass. They were very happy to get the ride and even happier that we were actually driving south of White Pass, meaning less skipped miles.\n\nAfter a couple of hours we arrived at the junction with the PCT. The four of us hiked for 15 minutes and decided to call it a day. There was a nice large campsite with water nearby and we were mentally exhausted from this day. It was a good call.\n\nAnd finally, finally, finally I had warm dinner again!", "slug": "packwood", "display_slug": "packwood", "type": 1, "start_time": 1723166381.293504, "end_time": null, "creation_time": 1723166396.554359, "location": {"id": 146805037, "name": "Packwood", "detail": "USA", "full_detail": "Washington, USA", "country_code": "US", "lat": 46.35687095117416, "lon": -121.51777949195495, "venue": null, "uuid": "BCABE3FD-BBAA-45D1-AFCB-6FD28C2822C4"}, "supertype": "normal", "is_deleted": false, "open_graph_id": null, "fb_publish_status": null, "timezone_id": "America/Los_Angeles", "views": 0, "comment_count": 0, "weather_condition": null, "weather_temperature": null, "uuid": "A75C9D9C-8DED-4363-BBA9-B3B184296052"}, {"id": 118708114, "trip_id": 10158283, "location_id": 146904505, "main_media_item_path": null, "name": "Goat Rocks and baby bear", "display_name": "Goat Rocks and baby bear", "description": "Day 115\nMile 2256.4 to mile 2287.4\nPCT Miles: 31.0 (49.6km)\nTotal Miles: 2287.4 (3659.8km)\n\nWe\u2019re back to magnificent mountain views!\n\nI left camp a bit before 6am, before the other people. I really enjoy \u2014 and have been enjoying \u2014 to hike alone.\n\nThe morning was tough with mosquitoes but before noon the situation had improved. It\u2019s really tough to hike uphill on a warm day wearing your rain clothes against the mosquitoes.\n\nNow I understand why the trail angels yesterday insisted on driving us one more hour so we could hike through the Goat Rocks. The views were absolutely amazing and I could also hike through one of the best named parts of the PCT. It\u2019s this narrow path on a ridge where you have (beautiful) cliffs on both sides. It\u2019s called the Knife\u2019s Edge \ud83d\udd2a.\n\nThe main characteristic of the PCT in Washignton are the steep ascends and descents. I totally felt that today. I went up and down on two passes today and that was an extreme exercise for my thighs and knees. At least there\u2019s no significant amount of snow (and I don\u2019t think there will be any for the rest of the trail).\n\nWhen I was literally seconds away from my campsite I heard something moving in the woods a bit ahead of me. I was sure it was a hiker that was camping at the same spot. Then it started to cross the trail three meters in front of me, completely unaware of my presence. It was a bear. A young, small beautiful brown-colored bear.\n\nI was absolutely in shock. That\u2019s what you always hear about black bears: they\u2019re only a threat if you stand between a mom and her cubs. The bear in front of me was definitely not a grown-up. Besides, differently from California, in Washington they also have grizzly bears, known to be much more aggressive towards humans than black bears (which, despite what the name might suggest, can be black or brown colored).\n\nFor a moment I forgot that there was a bear right in front of me and looked around to see if I could spot another bear, the mom. At this moment the young bear noticed me and in a split second ran uphill, away from me and from the campsite. The poor bear ran so fast that you could hear and feel the ground trembling when he stomped away.\n\nI waited a few seconds to see if there would be a follow up event, but I couldn\u2019t hear or see anything atypical. I walked 10 more steps and I was at the campsite. There was one other tent there. When the girl saw me from inside her tent she asked me: \u201cdid you hear that?

It was a couple, Paula and Ramon, and that was the second time that they\u2019re section hiking the PCT (the first time was 2019). \n\nAt Kracker Barrel, the usual in-and-out business: grab the resupply box, charge everything, eat \u201ctown food\u201d (frozen burrito and coffee), rest and go back to trail!

Washington has been absolutely gorgeously incredibly beautiful. Challenging with its steep hills, rainy and cold, but also very rewarding with magnificent views of lakes and mountains. Maybe it\u2019s because the wound is too recent, but I feel like Washington is the only section of the PCT that I would like to do again, in whole. Who knows?\n\nI had an entirely free morning! At 6am I was already eating the hot breakfast at the hotel like an animal \ud83e\udd94. At 7 was at the hotel\u2019s spa, alternating between using the jacuzzi with few laps on the cold swimming pool \ud83c\udfca. Around 10am I was already fully packed and slowly walking towards the bus station in the \u201cold downtown\u201d of Wenatchee.\n\nMy first stop was at an amazing book store.  I spent more than an hour browsing through the store until finally I exchanged my Adventures of Tom Sawyer (I absolutely couldn\u2019t read it: I didn\u2019t understand a thing after reading 10 pages) for Battlestar Galactica. After that. it was time for second breakfast in a nice coffee shop!\n\nFrom there I ended up at a nice market hall with a bit of everything: food, coffee, local art, breweries. Time for another break!\n\nAt 2:30pm I finally got into the bus to Pateros, where I would then take a bus to Twisp and finally take a final bus to Mazama, where I need to find a shuttle/trail angel to bring me to the trailhead. Well, one step at a time (not literally, unfortunately).\n\nWe saw one of the fires that were ahead of us from very, very close. Even the driver was clearly a bit uncomfortable to be driving kind of towards the fire. In the end everything was fine and it was actually cool to see the helicopters \ud83d\ude81 attacking the fire and creating the containment lines.\n\nOn this first bus we were 4 hikers. After arriving in Pateros, we became 8, since four other hikers arrived while we were waiting the bus to Twisp. We, PCT hikers, were the only passengers on the next buses, finally arriving in Manzama a bit after 6pm. Almost four hours of bus rides today \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8.\n\nAll the eight of us had the same plan: go to this \u201cLion\u2019s Den\u201d place in that we heard about to spend the night and go to the Hart\u2019s Pass trailhead tomorrow morning.

Today was my last day hiking the PCT.\n\nI woke up at 5:30 with Pete and Nick breaking out camp already. Pete\u2019s wife was at Hart\u2019s Pass waiting for him: they would drive together back home in south Idaho. Nick still has one month of visa and decided to stay in the US until the last day he can. He is going to Seattle now and then \u201cwe will see\u201d.\n\nAfter shaking their hands (an act that is not very common on the PCT: for hygienic reasons hikers usually greet each other with fist-bumps), I said \u201cyeah dudes. Nice to meet you both. See you next time!\u201d. Pete laughed. \u201cNext time\u201d. We all knew this is the last time I\u2019m seeing both of them.\n\nSoon after 6am I was already on my last ascend and my last pass on the PCT. I heard this morning from another hiker that this is actually the highest point in Washington that\u2019s part of the PCT. It was cold and at some point it started to rain. I couldn\u2019t have cared less.\n\nI crossed paths with at least 15 other hikers coming back from the Northern Terminus Monument: most hikers don\u2019t cross to Canada and instead, after finishing the PCT, they go back to Hart\u2019s Pass and find a ride back to civilization. You could see that most of them had red eyes showing that they had been crying recently. \n\nFor the last time I saw Ranger, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, Ghost, Ranger, Ruud, Marieke, J\u00e4germeister, Wind-up and Golden Shower. At every hiker coming on the opposite direction, the same gesture repeated: a fist bump followed by a \u201ccongrats, you did it!\u201d. Despite the excitement, everybody (including myself) looked absolutely exhausted.\n\nThe last three hikers that I crossed with before reaching the terminus told me the same thing, as if they were trying to somehow alert me. They all said that reaching the terminus was very emotional, that they started crying as soon as they saw the monument and kept crying for a few minutes. I was not sure what to expect.\n\nThe last person ahead of me was Ghost. Ruud and Marieke were the closest hikers behind me and they were more than one hour back. When I crossed paths with Ghost coming back from the terminus, I knew that I would be alone at the monument for as long as I wanted. I would have all the time I wanted to be emotional.\n\nAnd there it was. In a small clearance in the middle of nowhere, at the border between the United Stated and Canada, the end marker of the Pacific Crest Trail: the Northern Terminus Monument.\n\nI cheered with a beer that I had brought from Lion\u2019s Den, took a few photos, signed the trail record. Sat down and relaxed for a bit, ate a few snacks. I waited for the tears to roll down my face and for my emotional discharge to start.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for me to realize that it just wouldn\u2019t happen. And I believe I know exactly the reason why.\n\nFor me, the decision to hike the PCT (or the other long distance trails that I hiked before) never had an emotional factor. The main aspect that thrills me on those hikes is the adventure itself. I really enjoy the physical challenges and all the research and planning around these hikes. I like to learn knew things (I did so many things for the first time in the past four months, like wild camping or glissading a frozen mountain).\n\nMy two main rules for the PCT (1. don\u2019t die and 2. make wise decisions) are straightforward rules to make sure that I\u2019ll (literally) stay alive and complete my objective. Finishing the PCT has always been my main goal and every step I took (literally) in that direction came from a very analytical decision, not emotional.\n\nI always trusted that my body would be able to deal with all the challenges imposed by the PCT. During the past 128 days, I had only one blister that really bothered me (Bloopu \ud83e\udef6), a discomfort on my right knee and ankle (in and after the Sierra, when I broke my pole and had to hike with only one) and the soles of my feet that complained a bit after hiking for almost 5 weeks for more than 500 miles without a single rest day in NorCal and Oregon. I didn\u2019t have a single headache. I\u2019m happy to report that I had zero stomach issues. My body is my temple.\n\nBy the way, one of the most challenging tasks during the PCT was to kept this diary here and writing every single day on trail. I\u2019m really proud of myself that I kept up with that! I hope you all enjoyed \ud83d\ude0a!\n\nI finished my beer and look at the time. Twenty minutes had passed since I arrived at the monument. I felt weird to be enjoying such a long pause. My brain apparently still hadn\u2019t had processed that it was all over. Well, to be honest I still had to hike 8 miles to arrive in civilization in Canada. \n\nI got up, pack on my back for the last time and continued to hike for four more hours. No tears, no epiphanies, no emotional rollercoaster. I\u2019m just feeling the bliss of finalizing something that I have worked so hard to accomplish. I\u2019m feeling complete.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThank you so much for each and every one of you who followed me along in this adventure. All the likes, comments and follow requests that I received here really (really!) motivated me to keep going. I hope I could inspire some of you to go out there and seek for your own adventures (maybe hiking the PCT? \ud83d\ude43).\n\nThank you for my official support team! Special thanks to my friend Bruno who clearly had a lot of free time in his hands to keep commenting a lot of nonsense. And a super, mega, huge thanks to Chris who did so much (maybe too much!) to help me with the logistics over here. Thank you, thank you, thank you \ud83d\ude4f!\n\nIf you enjoyed the PCT, I encourage you to check out an incredible hike that I did with Maike \ud83d\udc9c (and Tani \ud83d\udc99 and Kyra \ud83d\udc9a!) last year: the Shikoku Henro Pilgrimage. It should be visible on my trips now (it was on Maike\u2019s account but apparently we can share a trip with multiple accounts now). Go, check it out!\n\nOnce more, thank you all so much! See you all next time \ud83d\ude09! \n\nBruno\n\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c", "slug": "okanogan-county", "display_slug": "okanogan-county", "type": 1, "start_time": 1724354914.552745, "end_time": null, "creation_time": 1724372843.028601, "location": {"id": 148997263, "name": "Okanogan County", "detail": "USA", "full_detail": "Washington, USA", "country_code": "US", "lat": 48.999712597624395, "lon": -120.80131226230488, "venue": null, "uuid": "9D40A8B3-AE74-47CD-B3F2-2494AF629AD4"}, "supertype": "normal", "is_deleted": false, "open_graph_id": null, "fb_publish_status": null, "timezone_id": "America/Vancouver", "views": 0, "comment_count": 44, "weather_condition": "partly-cloudy-day", "weather_temperature": 23.0, "uuid": "F2BABFB8-789B-4BAF-BCDE-5C8DCBF3A4F5"}]}
