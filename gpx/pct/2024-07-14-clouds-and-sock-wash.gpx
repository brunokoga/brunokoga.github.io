    <desc>Day 88
Mile 1324.9 to 1347.4
PCT Miles: 22.5 (36.0km)
Total Miles: 1347.4 (2199.0km)

Not much has happened in the morning. I‚Äôve been trying to shorten the time between waking up and start hiking. This morning it took me a bit over 20 minutes.

I crossed paths again with Sprouts, Banana Bread and 40 Count ‚Äî the three of them trying to hitch to town. I‚Äôm skipping this town (Chester) and instead I‚Äôll get (hopefully üò¨) my package that I sent to myself in the next town, Old Station!

I had a wonderful lunch break by the river. I knew I would have a ‚Äúshort‚Äù day today (around 23 miles) so took my time and soaked my feet in the cold water and scrubbed the dirt and all the ash off. My socks were so dirty and full of salt from feet sweat that they were stiff. It was actually hurting a bit as if I was wearing wooden socks. I vigorously washed them (in this heat and sun, they dried up in 20 minutes) and spent two hours chilling and eating my last portion of disgusting olivranola. I can‚Äôt wait for my package with more variety of food ü•¥.

Soon after my break some clouds started to show up (I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen clouds since I restarted the PCT) and it made the afternoon hike much more pleasant. I ended up my hiking day at 4:30 and for the first time in a long time I had time to stretch and enjoy some chill time between dinner and writing polarsteps/going to sleep. Now it‚Äôs actually pretty busy here at the camp site. There are at least 9 other hikers camping here tonight ‚ò∫Ô∏è.</desc>
