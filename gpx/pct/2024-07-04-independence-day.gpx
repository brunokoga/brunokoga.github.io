PCT Miles: 0
Total Miles: 1154.5 (1847.2km)

I really can get used to waking up at 8 and not at 5 ðŸ˜¬! After having a coffee and sandwiches at Beanstalk Cafe we walked to Yerba Buena Center for the Arts to visit a (free!) exhibition from Nick Dong. It had some crazy immersive artworks made either lights and mirrors. I really enjoyed it!

From there we walked to Embarcadero and stopped for lunch on the way. In between walking and occasional coffees, we had a very chill afternoon.

We took the train back to San Jose where Jessica and Chris picked us up and the four of us went out for dinner. After eating we realized that today we had breakfast, lunch AND dinner, something that hadnâ€™t happened in a while! (and we also noticed that I ate my food and half of Maikeâ€™s food in every single meal today ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‹)</desc>
