    <desc>Day 7
Mile 119.6 to mile 140.6
PCT Miles: 21.0 (33.6km)
Total Miles: 140.6 (224.9km)

One week on the PCT! And still alive!! ü•≥

Even though the night had been quite warm, I woke up a bit cold. As soon as I opened my tent, I realized why! Everything was very humid as I was in the middle of a dense mist. I tried to pack as soon as I could but the beauty of my surroundings made me a bit catatonic. I left camp at 6:40.

The morning was gorgeous! That was the most beautiful day I had in the PCT so far. For hours I could see from above the fog trapped in the valley. As the sun slowly showed up, the views of the top of the mountains over the fog were unbelievably beautiful. 

Not only the most beautiful day, but today was also the day where I had to carry 7.5 liters of water! I didn‚Äôt want to trust one of the water sources (a cistern that was rated as ‚Äúdry and full of dead animals‚Äù), so my alternative was to hike 24 miles plus dry camping in one go. But for that, one of the other water sources, called Mike‚Äôs Place and maintained upon donations, had to be working. My morning was divided between hiking, admiring the surroundings and praying for water.

At mile 127, I saw a sign that I was hoping for: the directions to Mike‚Äôs Place. A few more minutes walking off trail and I could see the big water tank. And it had water. Maravilha!

Time to camel up (drink water at a source until you can‚Äôt anymore) and fill every single bottle I had. Total 7.5 liters and a backpack that I almost couldn‚Äôt lift. I think it weighted something around 17-18 kilos‚Ä¶ ü•µ

Slowly but steadily I kept hiking and very consciously drinking water. In a way I had to save water to be sure I‚Äôd  have water for 24 miles plus dry camping, but I also wanted to get rid of the weight as soon as I could.

I‚Äôm so happy that Bloopu is gone. My left foot is much much better. I‚Äôm not sure I could have carried so much weight if Bloopu was there. Unfortunately it seems that some relative of Bloopu is starting to show up on my right little toe. I‚Äôm sure you all are very interested in this topic so I will keep you posted!

Around 5pm and after 21 miles I decided to make camp. Maybe I didn‚Äôt choose the best place because it‚Äôs super windy, but there‚Äôs absolutely no chance that I walk another single mile today. I‚Äôm glad that I have a proper tent and not only a tarp like some people hiking the PCT.

Tomorrow there‚Äôs a famous Caf√© that‚Äôs accessible hiking a bit off trail and I‚Äôm hoping to eat real food. Or as close as real food as you can get at an American Caf√© üòÖ!</desc>
