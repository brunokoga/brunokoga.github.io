    <desc>Day 109
Mile 2061.0 to mile 2089.3
PCT Miles: 28.3 (45.3km)
Total Miles: 2089.3 (3342.9km)

It was a very pleasant night with good temperatures and no condensation in the morning.

Right after I left camp I heard something moving on the bushes to my right. Clearly the bear had seen me first and it was already running to the opposite direction. I could only have a glance of its black furred butt and that was it!

After 16 miles, at lunch time â€” I was ready to eat my 700-calories-lunch-energy-bar-that-Iâ€™m-very-fed-up-with â€” my prayers were heard: there was a trail magic ahead!

I forgot to ask the name of todayâ€™s trail angel, but this is what she does: for the past 4 years, every year, she goes camping for about two weeks with her horses on a horse camp (yes, this exists) which is on a very short side trail from the PCT. She brings food for herself, hay for the horses and tons of foods and drinks for the PCT hikers!

I had cheese sandwiches, cookies and chips. It was good to eat something savory other than almonds or my cold-soaked dinners. I ate enough so I could skip dinner tonight (I canâ€™t with my food anymore ðŸ˜­). 

Having to hike still 13 miles to the camp site, at some point I had to stop eating and continue hiking. Another uneventful afternoon followed and I made camp early, around 6:30pm. For dinner I had wrap with nutella, freeze-dried strawberries and almonds. It was delicious!

Tomorrow we feast!</desc>
