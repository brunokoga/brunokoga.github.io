Mile 805.3 to mile 815.1
PCT Miles: 9.8 (15.7km)
Total Miles: 815.1 (1304.2km)

This was the coldest morning so far. I was awake at 5 and left camp at 5:40. There was a layer of frost over my tent and my backpack and my sleeping bag was wet on the outside due to the condensation. That plus wet socks and shoes is always fun!

Going over today‚Äôs pass, Pinchot Pass, was quite uneventful. I met Tangent, Bullfrog and Geezer on the way up and going down was also chill wearing the crampons.

After that, and before ascending to the next pass, Mather Pass, I crossed the most challenging stream so far. I had to hike upstream for almost one hour to find a good spot to cross. But all good üëç!

I took a break for an early lunch when I found a good spot with water, shade and a big rock to put my things to dry (tent, sleeping bag, socks). I knew that the day was already close to an end: the ascent to Mather Pass after 12pm was very difficult with the soft snow. I slowly climbed up until it was too much effort for not much gain. Again, it‚Äôs much better to do the ascent early in the morning, when the snow is refrozen overnight.

Around 14:30 I met Tangent, Bullfrog and Geezer again. They were having a lunch break. Soon after Fizz also showed up and we chilled together a bit.

I decided that that was it for the day! My body (mainly my legs) would really appreciate an afternoon off. I‚Äôm in one of the most beautiful places on the planet, it‚Äôs almost mandatory that I slow down and enjoy a bit! I found a nice spot for my tent and slowly I‚Äôm doing all the chores, stretching, reorganizing my things and also planning for the coming days. All of that surrounded by gorgeous mountains. Life could be worse üòå.</desc>
