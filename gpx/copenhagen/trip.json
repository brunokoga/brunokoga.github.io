Since we\u2019re the only people camping with a tent here (and that has been true for almost all our camping places), the owners decided to offer us the cabin because why not? We take that!\n\nInstead of pitching the tent, we had a hot shower before biking to an Asian all-you-can-eat restaurant. Back to our cabin, we are cozily warm, have wi-fi and can charge our phones. Not bad for our last night before arriving in Copenhagen \ud83e\udd29!\n\nBruno", "slug": "stevns", "display_slug": "stevns", "type": 1, "start_time": 1745165812.129327, "end_time": null, "creation_time": 1745329560.125647, "location": {"id": 191810594, "name": "Stevns", "detail": "Denmark", "full_detail": "Zealand, Denmark", "country_code": "DK", "lat": 55.24885559082031, "lon": 12.33158874511719, "venue": null, "uuid": "664d78d9-2296-437b-99db-47c307d0bf9c"}, "supertype": "normal", "is_deleted": false, "open_graph_id": null, "fb_publish_status": null, "timezone_id": "Europe/Copenhagen", "views": 0, "comment_count": 1, "weather_condition": "partly-cloudy-day", "weather_temperature": 9.0, "uuid": "ecd2c6b2-864d-4353-8c8b-5764cee472ca"}, {"id": 154898749, "trip_id": 16654959, "location_id": 191813067, "main_media_item_path": null, "name": "Copenhaaaaaagen ", "display_name": "Copenhaaaaaagen ", "description": "Last day starting now! \u23f1\ufe0f We left our lovely cabin behind and started cycling under a grey sky. We were set for an 80km day, so not the shortest of days! First quick stop: UNESCO world heritage Stevns Klint. Being an early bird has its perks, as we were almost the only ones there.\n\nThen we powered through 43km until K\u00f8ge, where we had a pok\u00e9 bowl (we were getting a little bit tired of bread with cheese being the only vegetarian option) and stocked up snacks at the supermarket. One of them being a peanut butter mochi??!!! \ud83e\udd29 \n\nShortly before arriving in our final destination of this whole trip, we stopped at the beach for some rest \ud83e\udee0 Boy, it was hard to get up on the bike for the last 12km after that pause \ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8 \n\nHappy and exhausted we finally arrived at our cool hostel! Two weeks ago, we had sent ourselves a package to the hostel, containing more clothes, socks, underwear and bagpacks for our stuff. Unfortunately the package hasn\u2019t arrived and we went only dressed in our rain stuff (\ud83e\udd76) to the laundromat once more. Just a typical day in the city! (See Rostock) \n\nUntil now, we\u2019ve been enjoying Copenhagens deer park, it\u2019s lovely streets and buildings, the cute cafes and a cool Lars von Trier exhibition in an old church. One more day, one more cinnamon roll to go!
