    <desc>Last day starting now! ⏱️ We left our lovely cabin behind and started cycling under a grey sky. We were set for an 80km day, so not the shortest of days! First quick stop: UNESCO world heritage Stevns Klint. Being an early bird has its perks, as we were almost the only ones there.

Then we powered through 43km until Køge, where we had a poké bowl (we were getting a little bit tired of bread with cheese being the only vegetarian option) and stocked up snacks at the supermarket. One of them being a peanut butter mochi??!!! 🤩 

Shortly before arriving in our final destination of this whole trip, we stopped at the beach for some rest 🫠 Boy, it was hard to get up on the bike for the last 12km after that pause 😮‍💨 

Happy and exhausted we finally arrived at our cool hostel! Two weeks ago, we had sent ourselves a package to the hostel, containing more clothes, socks, underwear and bagpacks for our stuff. Unfortunately the package hasn’t arrived and we went only dressed in our rain stuff (🥶) to the laundromat once more. Just a typical day in the city! (See Rostock) 

Until now, we’ve been enjoying Copenhagens deer park, it’s lovely streets and buildings, the cute cafes and a cool Lars von Trier exhibition in an old church. One more day, one more cinnamon roll to go! </desc>
