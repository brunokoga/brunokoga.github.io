<p>Mile 162.7 (Cedar Spring) to Idyllwild</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 16.7 (26.7km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 179.4 (287km)</p>
<p>I didnâ€™t sleep very well with all the wind and the anticipation that today I would have the most challenging day on the PCT so far. Oh boy if only I knewâ€¦</p>
<p>I decided to have a coffee and a tea to warm me up before I left camp. One of the obvious advantages of camping close to a spring is that you have unlimited water. I wanted to wait for the wind to become less intense and for the cold and condensation on my tent to dissipate a bit.</p>
<p>Wearing for the first time my fleece and my gloves ðŸ§¤ I left camp at 8. 1 mile hiking up back to trail ðŸ¤¬ and then off I went toâ€¦ the middle of the storm.</p>
<p>To be fair, it didnâ€™t rain (or snow or hail) but the wind was so strong and so cold that at some times I had to stop hiking just to keep my balance. Today I was not hiding under the trees for shade. I was hiding behind rocks or bushes for wind protection.</p>
<p>Not only it was a steep climb of more than 2000 feet to a maximum elevation on 8800 feet in was also not carrying so much water. I was hoping not to drink too much since it was not so warm. The problem is that the ascent took much more than I thought. It was super steep (and windy!!). Not only the physical effort was huge, I tried my best to keep it slow to prevent altitude sickness.</p>
<p>There were trees and branches and rocks spread all over the path. To be honest it really made the hike more fun (jump over or crawl under a tree, finding ways of going around impenetrable blobs of branches, etc) but it also made it so much slow. I was hiking under 1.5 mile an hour and that was simply not going to work.</p>
<p>Around lunchtime I passed this group of 4 people. As I usually do, I quickly stop to introduce myself, wish them a good day and carry on with my bike. Hi, Iâ€™m Bruno, I said. Toni, Noelle, Tenor and Virginia they replied! Have I nice day, I wished to them. You too, they replied. Oh by the way thereâ€™s something on in your fanny pack, Toni yelled. I noticed that</p>
<p>my headlamp was on for some reason. The light was very faint, so it probably was on for the whole</p>
<p>morning (and past evening?). I turned it off and yelled back: thank you!</p>
<p>At mile 169, I saw what I was absolutely not looking forward: snow and ice on the path. The first test was actually a steep cliff edge. Remembering the first rule (donâ€™t die!) I decided to put my micro spikes on. But before, time to read the manual as I had no idea what I was doingâ€¦ It turned out to be pretty straightforward and there I was, all micro spiked and ready for some ice and snow action!</p>
<p>Everything went fine. There was not thaaat amount</p>
<p>of snow and I felt safe all the time. It was just impossible to look down at the cliffs. Every step in inclined snow took me forever, which I donâ€™t regret.</p>
<p>Even the sun decided to show up (after I was above the clouds). It was still very cold and windy but sunny. Maybe too sunny. I started drinking much more water and I was so relieved when I found a spring from melted snow running alongside a rock wall. Time to refill!</p>
<p>Because it took me so long to hike today, I decided not to go to Idylllwild and instead camp on top of the mountain. I heard that the descend to Idyllwild was a bit steep and there was a considerable amount of ice and snow. Better to do it tomorrow morning when my body is rested.</p>
<p>I couldnâ€™t wait to make camp. I didnâ€™t have more lunch food and I ate all my snacks during the day. The only thing left was a knorr spaghetti and a couscous, both I had to cook. I was really looking forward to a warm meal!</p>
<p>At 5 I finally found the last place to camp before the descend to Idyllwild. It was a beautiful place with a beautiful view to both sides of the mountain. I was alone and there was not much protection from the wind though, so I pitched my tent with some struggle. I used big rocks to secure my tent stakes in place. Everything good, time for some well deserved rest and warm food!</p>
<p>What a crazy day! While I was pitching my tent I thought that this was probably the most adventurous and challenging hike day Iâ€™ve ever had. So exhausting but so rewarding!</p>
<p>It indeed ended up being the most adventurous day of my life. But not for what had happened already, but for what was still to happenâ€¦</p>
<p>to be continuedâ€¦</p>
