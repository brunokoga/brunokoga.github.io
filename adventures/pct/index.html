<p>Mile 2638.3 to PCT Northern Terminus Monument</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 16.9 (27.0km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 2655.2 (4248.3km)</p>
<p>Since early in the morning, I felt that today was meant to be emotional. Today was my last day hiking the PCT.</p>
<p>I woke up at 5:30 with Pete and Nick breaking out camp already. Pete’s wife was at Hart’s Pass waiting for him: they would drive together back home in south Idaho. Nick still has one month of visa and decided to stay in the US until the last day he can. He is going to Seattle now and then “we will see”.</p>
<p>After shaking their hands (an act that is not very common on the PCT: for hygienic reasons hikers usually greet each other with fist-bumps), I said “yeah dudes. Nice to meet you both. See you next time!”. Pete laughed. “Next time”. We all knew this is the last time I’m seeing both of them.</p>
<p>Soon after 6am I was already on my last ascend and my last pass on the PCT. I heard this morning from another hiker that this is actually the highest point in Washington that’s part of the PCT. It was cold and at some point it started to rain. I couldn’t have cared less.</p>
<p>I crossed paths with at least 15 other hikers coming back from the Northern Terminus Monument: most hikers don’t cross to Canada and instead, after finishing the PCT, they go back to Hart’s Pass and find a ride back to civilization. You could see that most of them had red eyes showing that they had been crying recently.</p>
<p>For the last time I saw Ranger, Hélène, Ghost, Ranger, Ruud, Marieke, Jägermeister, Wind-up and Golden Shower. At every hiker coming on the opposite direction, the same gesture repeated: a fist bump followed by a “congrats, you did it!”. Despite the excitement, everybody (including myself) looked absolutely exhausted.</p>
<p>The last three hikers that I crossed with before reaching the terminus told me the same thing, as if they were trying to somehow alert me. They all said that reaching the terminus was very emotional, that they started crying as soon as they saw the monument and kept crying for a few minutes. I was not sure what to expect.</p>
<p>The last person ahead of me was Ghost. Ruud and Marieke were the closest hikers behind me and they were more than one hour back. When I crossed paths with Ghost coming back from the terminus, I knew that I would be alone at the monument for as long as I wanted. I would have all the time I wanted to be emotional.</p>
<p>And there it was. In a small clearance in the middle of nowhere, at the border between the United Stated and Canada, the end marker of the Pacific Crest Trail: the Northern Terminus Monument.</p>
<p>I cheered with a beer that I had brought from Lion’s Den, took a few photos, signed the trail record. Sat down and relaxed for a bit, ate a few snacks. I waited for the tears to roll down my face and for my emotional discharge to start.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for me to realize that it just wouldn’t happen. And I believe I know exactly the reason why.</p>
<p>For me, the decision to hike the PCT (or the other long distance trails that I hiked before) never had an emotional factor. The main aspect that thrills me on those hikes is the adventure itself. I really enjoy the physical challenges and all the research and planning around these hikes. I like to learn knew things (I did so many things for the first time in the past four months, like wild camping or glissading a frozen mountain).</p>
<p>My two main rules for the PCT (1. don’t die and 2. make wise decisions) are straightforward rules to make sure that I’ll (literally) stay alive and complete my objective. Finishing the PCT has always been my main goal and every step I took (literally) in that direction came from a very analytical decision, not emotional.</p>
<p>I always trusted that my body would be able to deal with all the challenges imposed by the PCT. During the past 128 days, I had only one blister that really bothered me (Bloopu 🫶), a discomfort on my right knee and ankle (in and after the Sierra, when I broke my pole and had to hike with only one) and the soles of my feet that complained a bit after hiking for almost 5 weeks for more than 500 miles without a single rest day in NorCal and Oregon. I didn’t have a single headache. I’m happy to report that I had zero stomach issues. My body is my temple.</p>
<p>By the way, one of the most challenging tasks during the PCT was to kept this diary here and writing every single day on trail. I’m really proud of myself that I kept up with that! I hope you all enjoyed 😊!</p>
<p>I finished my beer and look at the time. Twenty minutes had passed since I arrived at the monument. I felt weird to be enjoying such a long pause. My brain apparently still hadn’t had processed that it was all over. Well, to be honest I still had to hike 8 miles to arrive in civilization in Canada.</p>
<p>I got up, pack on my back for the last time and continued to hike for four more hours. No tears, no epiphanies, no emotional rollercoaster. I’m just feeling the bliss of finalizing something that I have worked so hard to accomplish. I’m feeling complete.</p>
<p>————</p>
<p>Thank you so much for each and every one of you who followed me along in this adventure. All the likes, comments and follow requests that I received here really (really!) motivated me to keep going. I hope I could inspire some of you to go out there and seek for your own adventures (maybe hiking the PCT? 🙃).</p>
<p>Thank you for my official support team! Special thanks to my friend Bruno who clearly had a lot of free time in his hands to keep commenting a lot of nonsense. And a super, mega, huge thanks to Chris who did so much (maybe too much!) to help me with the logistics over here. Thank you, thank you, thank you 🙏!</p>
<p>If you enjoyed the PCT, I encourage you to check out an incredible hike that I did with Maike 💜 (and Tani 💙 and Kyra 💚!) last year: the Shikoku Henro Pilgrimage. It should be visible on my trips now (it was on Maike’s account but apparently we can share a trip with multiple accounts now). Go, check it out!</p>
<p>Once more, thank you all so much! See you all next time 😉!</p>
<p>Bruno</p>

<p>From Lion’s Den there’s a trail angel who does shuttles to Hart’s Pass, about one our ride. There was a full van leaving at 6:30am and I was scheduled to leave with two other hikers at 9:30am.</p>
<p>With time to spare in the morning, I used one of the loaner bikes 🚲 that they have here and went to the bakery. I had the best cinnamon roll that I ever had in my life, hands down. Good start for the penultimate day on the PCT!</p>
<p>At 9:30am, the two other hikers decided to take a zero (they were vortexed by the Lion’s Den and the cinnamon rolls) and I was the only hiker in the shuttle. I could lay down and I literally took a half hour nap!</p>
<p>On the trail itself nothing special. It’s pretty cold, but hopefully it won’t rain and I’ll stay dry for my last day!</p>
<p>While I was having dinner, two southbounders arrived and joined me at camp: it was Pete and Nick! They finished the PCT earlier today and now they’re hiking back, since they don’t want hike into Canada.</p>

<p>Steven’s Pass to Mazama</p>
<p>PCT Miles: skipped from 2466.8 to 2624.7 (157.9 miles) due to Shoofly, Miner’s Complex, Pioneer, Flat Creek and Easy fires.</p>
<p>Total Miles: 2624.7 (4199.5km)</p>
<p>The section that I had to skip today was the most hurtful of all the skipped miles of the trail. Washington has been absolutely gorgeously incredibly beautiful. Challenging with its steep hills, rainy and cold, but also very rewarding with magnificent views of lakes and mountains. Maybe it’s because the wound is too recent, but I feel like Washington is the only section of the PCT that I would like to do again, in whole. Who knows?</p>
<p>I had an entirely free morning! At 6am I was already eating the hot breakfast at the hotel like an animal 🦔. At 7 was at the hotel’s spa, alternating between using the jacuzzi with few laps on the cold swimming pool 🏊. Around 10am I was already fully packed and slowly walking towards the bus station in the “old downtown” of Wenatchee.</p>
<p>My first stop was at an amazing book store.  I spent more than an hour browsing through the store until finally I exchanged my Adventures of Tom Sawyer (I absolutely couldn’t read it: I didn’t understand a thing after reading 10 pages) for Battlestar Galactica. After that. it was time for second breakfast in a nice coffee shop!</p>
<p>From there I ended up at a nice market hall with a bit of everything: food, coffee, local art, breweries. Time for another break!</p>
<p>At 2:30pm I finally got into the bus to Pateros, where I would then take a bus to Twisp and finally take a final bus to Mazama, where I need to find a shuttle/trail angel to bring me to the trailhead. Well, one step at a time (not literally, unfortunately).</p>
<p>We saw one of the fires that were ahead of us from very, very close. Even the driver was clearly a bit uncomfortable to be driving kind of towards the fire. In the end everything was fine and it was actually cool to see the helicopters 🚁 attacking the fire and creating the containment lines.</p>
<p>On this first bus we were 4 hikers. After arriving in Pateros, we became 8, since four other hikers arrived while we were waiting the bus to Twisp. We, PCT hikers, were the only passengers on the next buses, finally arriving in Manzama a bit after 6pm. Almost four hours of bus rides today 😮‍💨.</p>
<p>All the eight of us had the same plan: go to this “Lion’s Den” place in that we heard about to spend the night and go to the Hart’s Pass trailhead tomorrow morning. So we all went together to Lion’s Den. And that was a cool place to be!</p>

<p>At Lion’s Den they have a few beds, virtually unlimited space to camp and a “hiker hut” which is a mini-chalet with a kitchen, bathroom and common area for the hikers. Everything is donation based.</p>
<p>This year, with so many fires around this region, hikers are arriving here with too much food (like</p>
<p>me). The result is that the hiker boxes are not only completely full, but full with good stuff. So here you also eat and drink as much as you want for free.</p>
<p>This was my favorite stay on the PCT. It felt a little bittersweet to leave this morning instead of taking a zero like the other hikers, since I’m in no rush. On the other hand 🖐️ I cannot wait to finish the PCT. Two. More. Days.</p>

<p>It’s so funny how I’m still not used to be in the US: on google maps, it shows that from the bus stop to my hotel is only two blocks. From the hotel to the laundromat, two more blocks. Then, two more blocks to the convenience store. Easy peasy! Except that every block takes a lifetime to walk.</p>
<p>I spent my whole afternoon walking on the infinite sidewalks taking care of annoying details of my town chores: I had to walk for almost an hour to exchange my bills into coins, so I could pay the laundry machine. I also had to rearrange the furniture in my hotel room to fit all the hanging-to-dry gear that’s spread around. At least I got my pizza!</p>
<p>Tomorrow it’s a zero, but it’s a looong travel day.</p>

<p>Mile 2463.4 to Steven’s Pass</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 3.4 (5.4km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 2466.8 (3946.9km)</p>
<p>It didn’t rain during the night but everything I had was a bit (very) wet this morning due the wet ground and the condensation. To make the situation slightly more uncomfortable, I left one of my shoes kind of not exactly under the rain fly: in the morning it had a little pool inside the shoe.</p>
<p>Packing and breaking out camp was horrible but the prospect of hot coffee and town food helped with the motivation. My tent was so wet that it lept dripping from my backpack on my butt for the whole 3.4 miles to Steven’s Pass (which is basically a mini convenience store).</p>
<p>Two large lattes and few snacks later, at 11:30am, me, Sarah, Pete and Nick took the bus to the curious town of Leavenworth (where I had my last resupply box waiting for me).</p>

<p>Leavenworth must be the most curious village I’ve been in the PCT. It’s fully themed with a Bavarian-style (even the Mc Donald’s and Starbucks signs are Bavarianized!) and the bakeries, restaurants and saloons all serve german beer and food.</p>
<p>I was here for a little bit more than two hours: just enough to grab my last resupply and take another bus to Wenatchee.</p>
<p>The location for this resupply box clearly was not ideal, since I have nothing else to do here. When I sent it, on day 113, I was not sure of what to do.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I’ll have to skip a few more miles</p>
<p>of the PCT due five (yes, FIVE) different wildfires that are burning ahead of me: Shoofly, Miner’s Complex, Pioneer, Flat Creek and Easy.</p>
<p>That will take me more than one day of travel (including today). Soon I’ll take a free bus 🆓🚌 to the city of Wenatchee where I’ll stay in a hotel for the night, dry all my gear, do laundry and hopefully eat a good pizza. Tomorrow I’ll take a bus to Pateros, then another to Twisp and from there take another bus to Mazama, where I’ll try to camp and get a ride to Hart’s Pass (where I continue the PCT). My goal is to arrive there with enough time to chill and start hiking on Wednesday (today is Monday).</p>

<p>I woke up first with an intense flash. If I wasn’t already awake, the massive thunder that came a few seconds later would certainly do the job.</p>
<p>Even though I was a bit scared in the beginning, I soon fell asleep again. The thunderstorm lasted for about two hours, but it rained the whole night until morning. I had to break out camp (and dig a cat hole) under rain.</p>
<p>My tent and some of my stuff were wet, but nothing extreme. Truth be told, everything held up well and I was very warm and dry during the night. During the day the sun showed up for a little bit, more than enough time for me to hang my tent to dry.</p>
<p>Washington is beautiful and even with the fog and rain I’ve been enjoying a lot to hike here. Once more: it’s super cool to see how many people come to hike and camp over the weekends (it’s Sunday). I saw a lot of day hikers and weekenders today.</p>

<p>Against all the odds and forecasts, the morning was cloudless and sunny. The clear skies lasted for the whole day. I’m writing this at 6:30pm and it’s hard to believe that the forecast is, still, for thunderstorms and rain. It should start around 9pm.</p>
<p>Besides that no big surprises during the day. With no pressure for doing big miles, I took my time to hike at a lower pace and enjoy longer breaks. I was at camp before 5pm but unfortunately there are a few bugs around making my evening a bit less enjoyable.</p>
<p>Today was the last time I hiked 20 or more miles. It’s crazy to think that the end is less than one week away!</p>

<p>It rained most part of the night and it was raining in the morning when I woke up! I think it’s the first time that this happens on the PCT.</p>
<p>What was certainly the first time for me was making tea and having breakfast in the tent before even starting the hiking day. I need to be in Steven’s Pass only on Monday (60 miles away) so I’m taking my time. I left camp this morning at 8:30am 😎!</p>
<p>It was only the second time that I was wearing my rain jacket (the first was on day 58, in the Sierra). It didn’t rain for too long, but the fog persisted for the whole morning. Everything was wet and white.</p>
<p>Still in the morning, I saw a mountain goat for the first time. She gently left the trail and let me pass. It was the perfect encounter.</p>
<p>While I was having lunch (belvita cookies with a block of cheese 🍪🧀), the sky cleared and the sun started to shine. If you had told me in the morning that I would have sun today still, I wouldn’t have believed. Time to hang my tent to dry!</p>
<p>The afternoon was under sun and entirely uphill for 3 hours. At least this time I had some nice views!</p>

<p>Snoqualmie Pass to mile 2405.5</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 9.7 (15.5km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 2405.5 (3848.8km)</p>
<p>After having infinite pancakes 🥞 and coffee for breakfast and helping with my chore at the “hostel” (take out the trash 🗑️) I slowly started making my way to the coffee shop to use the wifi to organize the next steps of the hike, including entering in Canada and understanding what to do and where to go once I cross the border. It really feels like it’s the beginning of the end!</p>
<p>Around noon I started my hiking day. I want to be at Steven’s Pass, where I will catch a bus to skip the upcoming wildfires, on Monday morning. This gives me 4 days to hike 71 miles, which is way below my average. That’s why I’m bringing a book with me for this section!</p>
<p>The plan was to hike slowly and enjoy the views, but there were no views and it was too cold to hike slowly. I ended up making camp at 5pm after hiking 10 miles.</p>
<p>It’s probably going to be very cold tonight but the good news is that I have absolutely no time pressure so I’ll take my time to wake up and break out camp, maybe even having a proper breakfast and hot tea before starting to hike 😋!</p>

<p>Mile 2390.4 to Snoqualmie Pass</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 5.4 (8.6km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 2395.8 (3833.3km)</p>
<p>It was a double chill morning: it was really cold and the only time pressure I had was that the earlier I hiked the remaining 5.4 miles to “town”, the earlier I would have warm breakfast and hot coffee!</p>
<p>Arrived at the coffee shop around 9am and stayed until noon with Jesse, Lily and Ranger (we all camped together last night). I got my resupply box at the gas station and sorted my food for the next days.</p>
<p>From there I went to my accommodation: a chalet/lodge called Washington Alpine Club. They offer a good deal for hikers which includes dinner and breakfast, clean towels and loaner clothes (clothes to use while yours are being washed). Every guest has also to pick up a chore. Mine was to take the trash out.</p>
<p>I had the immense surprise of meeting Geezer one more time here at the WAC! I hadn’t seen him since I took the wrong trail in the Sierras, on day 50! We had pizza for lunch together and chatted about the past days! I really miss hiking with Geezer, Bullfrog and Tangent! The group that we kindly named the Harry Pottheads 🪄!</p>
<p>For dinner we had infinite spaghetti 🍝 and various salads 🥗. Some of the vegetables were</p>
<p>even grown at the property itself!</p>
<p>For the coming days, I’m going to slow down a little bit and I decided to bring a book. I found two books here that I could read and decided to bring The Adventures of Tom Sawyer with me. It’s the first time on the PCT that I’m carrying a book 📕!</p>

<p>Once more, cold wet morning. It didn’t rain but you could feel the wetness coming out of the moisture from the mist and leaves.</p>
<p>The star of the day were without a doubt the huckleberry fields!</p>
<p>When the first huckleberries  showed up still early in the morning, I couldn’t pick them because my fingers were too cold and I was unable to pinch 🫐🤏 . Gladly the fields lasted for the whole day and later, after a few uphills, I warmed up and could eat a fair share of huckleberries. For lunch I had the best electronola so far (with, of course, huckleberries)!</p>
<p>It was a lower-than-average mile day. I’m camping</p>
<p>close to Snoqualmie Pass (a ski resort), where I plan to spend the day and night tomorrow.</p>
<p>If everything goes according to the plan, I will get a resupply package (that I sent to a gas station in Snoqualmie Pass) for the coming three days. The idea is to stay there for the day and plan the last days of the PCT (including the last detour because of wildfires).</p>

<p>I’m glad that I brought warmer clothes for Washington. It was a chilly night and morning.</p>
<p>For most of the day I hiked through a very dense fog/mist. When hiking in the forest, this mist made everything wet and created a kind of rain, creating water drops that would fall from the tree leaves. When hiking on more exposed areas like ridges, I could see the thick mist moving, like a big cloud.</p>
<p>Besides that, not much to add: it was a nice and calm hiking day. I met some enthusiastic local hikers that congratulated me for being “almost there”, enjoyed a few sun breaks and finished the audiobook “Greenlights” for the second time!</p>

<p>Completely different from Oregon, the Washington section of the PCT is full of up and downhills. I have the feeling that here the hills are steeper than in most of the PCT.</p>
<p>It’s cool to be in the mountains again and go over passes. In the Sierra, all the passes I crossed were over snow and ice. Here I expect to see almost no snow. It is nice to be able to cross the passes following an actual trail!</p>
<p>There were an impressive amount of day hikers, families, groups of young people today. Since yesterday, the camping spots have been disputed. I said this a few times already, but I think it’s so cool that people hike and camp as a hobby ✨!</p>
<p>Washington so far has been very tough but very beautiful. It’s a good trade off 🙃.</p>

<p>Mile 2287.4 to mile 2310.0</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 22.6 (36.2km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 2310.0 (3696.0km)</p>
<p>The first ten miles of the day, from the campsite to White Pass Kracker Barrel (the General Store where my next resupply box is), were under quite some smoke. It was a bit not ideal to breathe but I kept hiking — what else can you do? — and at 10:30 I arrived at Kracker Barrel with no major incidents.</p>
<p>Still in the morning I met the first Brazilians on trail (other than me, of course). It was a couple, Paula and Ramon, and that was the second time that they’re section hiking the PCT (the first time was 2019).</p>
<p>At Kracker Barrel, the usual in-and-out business: grab the resupply box, charge everything, eat “town food” (frozen burrito and coffee), rest and go back to trail! At 1pm I was already hiking north again.</p>
<p>After resupplying, I’m currently carrying 4 days worth of food. I just realized that this is the last time on the PCT that I will carry such a big amount (it’s crazy to think that I already carried NINE days of food in the Sierra!).</p>
<p>Hiking in the afternoon was pretty chill, with no stress of making big miles. With the last trail closures, I’m at least one week ahead of schedule. In fact, because of the upcoming wildfire-related trail closures ahead (where I’ll probably have to skip around 150 miles more), I might be as close as two weeks of finishing the PCT!</p>

<p>We’re back to magnificent mountain views!</p>
<p>I left camp a bit before 6am, before the other people. I really enjoy — and have been enjoying — to hike alone.</p>
<p>The morning was tough with mosquitoes but before noon the situation had improved. It’s really tough to hike uphill on a warm day wearing your rain clothes against the mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Now I understand why the trail angels yesterday insisted on driving us one more hour so we could hike through the Goat Rocks. The views were absolutely amazing and I could also hike through one of the best named parts of the PCT. It’s this narrow path on a ridge where you have (beautiful) cliffs on both sides. It’s called the Knife’s Edge 🔪.</p>
<p>The main characteristic of the PCT in Washignton are the steep ascends and descents. I totally felt that today. I went up and down on two passes today and that was an extreme exercise for my thighs and knees. At least there’s no significant amount of snow (and I don’t think there will be any for the rest of the trail).</p>
<p>When I was literally seconds away from my campsite I heard something moving in the woods a bit ahead of me. I was sure it was a hiker that was camping at the same spot. Then it started to cross the trail three meters in front of me, completely unaware of my presence. It was a bear. A young, small beautiful brown-colored bear.</p>
<p>I was absolutely in shock. That’s what you always hear about black bears: they’re only a threat if you stand between a mom and her cubs. The bear in front of me was definitely not a grown-up. Besides, differently from California, in Washington they also have grizzly bears, known to be much more aggressive towards humans than black bears (which, despite what the name might suggest, can be black or brown colored).</p>
<p>For a moment I forgot that there was a bear right in front of me and looked around to see if I could spot another bear, the mom. At this moment the young bear noticed me and in a split second ran uphill, away from me and from the campsite. The poor bear ran so fast that you could hear and feel the ground trembling when he stomped away.</p>
<p>I waited a few seconds to see if there would be a follow up event, but I couldn’t hear or see anything atypical. I walked 10 more steps and I was at the campsite. There was one other tent there. When the girl saw me from inside her tent she asked me: “did you hear that? I think it might have been a deer running away”. “Yeah” — I replied — “I think so too”.</p>

<p>Mile 2255.7 to mile 2256.4 (skipped from mile 2149.8 to mile 2255.7 (105.9 miles) due the official PCT William’s Mine Fire closure)</p>

<p>Total Miles: 2256.4 (3610.2km)</p>
<p>Once more I had a hard time trying to fall asleep. Without any need of waking up early the next morning, I kept watching Olympic Games on the hotel’s TV until way past hiker’s midnight.</p>
<p>I woke up and went to the same coffee shop that I went yesterday and had a breakfast burrito (I’ll miss those!) and an iced latte. I was finishing my coffee when Clara showed up! I wasn’t expecting her to arrive so early. It was so cool to see her and to be able to have a coffee together! Besides day 1, it’s the third time that I meet Clara on trail! 🫶</p>
<p>We, of course, discussed about the ultra recent William’s Mine Fire closure. Apparently the best thing to do would be to skip around 150 miles and go straight to White Pass. Clara told me that she would stay at least one night in Cascade Locks and she would research alternative routes around the fire. She had no idea exactly how to do it, but she wanted to spend some time and energy (and maybe finding some help) to figure out an alternative. Fair enough.</p>
<p>I told her that I was not very enthusiastic about the idea of finding alternative unofficial routes around a wildfire and I would, then, find my way to White Pass. I was in no rush, though.</p>
<p>Most northbound hikers (like me) are taking the $10 bus to Portland, spending one night there and then finding a ride to White Pass. I decided that I would do the same, but I would spend more time in Portland.</p>
<p>Ok, so here is my plan — I told Clara — I’ll go to Portland, buy a book and spend the weekend chilling and reading. And then next week I find a ride to White Pass and continue the hike. That’s a good plan, she confirmed.</p>
<p>So we left the coffee shop to go meet her group at a restaurant 2 minutes away. As we cross the street somebody shouts: are you northbound hikers? Do you want a ride to White Pass?</p>
<p>In five seconds I changed my plans: yes! I replied. I couldn’t refuse such an easy and unusual ride offer like this. To drive to White Pass you really need to go around the mountains (it’s a 4 hours drive!). I told them (it was a guy and his mom) that I needed to still pack my stuff and check out from my room. No problem, they said. “We still have space for 3 more hikers, you’re the first one”. Great!</p>
<p>Clara shared her plans with them and they replied: “oh, yesterday we spend four hours working on this alternative route and we actually submitted a proposal to the PCTA to accept this route, since we believe it’s pretty safe. Here’s a printed map and a link to the file so you can download the route on your phone!”.</p>
<p>She couldn’t believe what she was listening! This is exactly what she wanted! We said our goodbyes and I rushed to pack and leave. The two trail angels spent almost one hour trying to find other hikers for the ride, but in the end they only found one more. Around noon we left Cascade Locks heading to White Pass!</p>
<p>On the way they explained that they, mother and son, live in Portland and are PCTA volunteers for that section of the PCT. They hiked the PCT together last year and this year they intended to do trail magic exactly at the part of the trail that was closed due this new fire, two days ago. They figured that the best way to help hikers then would be to use the day to give a ride north to White Pass to northbound hikers and on the way back give a ride to Cascade Locks to southbounders. It’s a 4 hours drive each way.</p>
<p>After three hours driving they offered to bring us not to White Pass, but a dozen miles south, closer to where the actual trail closure is. To get there, it would add more than one hour to the trip, driving on forest unpaved and unmaintained roads. That would be amazing, we replied. So that was the new plan!</p>
<p>Right after we agreed on the new route, we saw two hikers hitching right ahead of us. The mom and son (I didn’t ask their names!!) were over the moon to be able to help more hikers. They were clearly a bit unsatisfied driving with only two hikers. Now we were a full car!</p>
<p>When we stopped on the road side and the hikers started loading their backpacks into the car when one of them suddenly asked “Bruno? Is that you?”.</p>
<p>It was Pete (from days 1 and 71)! He and Nick (another guy who I saw a few times already) were actually on trail when it was closed and had to go back and had spent the whole day taking buses after buses to get to White Pass. They were very happy to get the ride and even happier that we were actually driving south of White Pass, meaning less skipped miles.</p>
<p>After a couple of hours we arrived at the junction with the PCT. The four of us hiked for 15 minutes and decided to call it a day. There was a nice large campsite with water nearby and we were mentally exhausted from this day. It was a good call.</p>
<p>And finally, finally, finally I had warm dinner again!</p>

<p>I had breakfast at a nice artsy coffee shop nearby, where I met some hikers who were on the exact same situation as me: they had arrived two days ago and now they didn’t know what to do.</p>
<p>Me and another hiker even went to the post office as soon as it opened to try to retrieve our boxes back to no avail: the packages were already on their way.</p>
<p>After breakfast I went back to the post office and sent the last two boxes (what could I do?). I had to decide what to do now. Physically, I was ready to start hiking. But I knew I couldn’t start hiking without knowing more about the conditions ahead. Remember: 1) Don’t die; and 2) Make wise decisions.</p>
<p>I decided to take a zero. I booked the inn room for one more night and tried to slow down a little and analyze my options. I was (and am) feeling absolutely frustrated with these fire closures. Now, I have packages all over the place with food that I won’t need and I have to find a way to retrieve them. Also, what am I going to do? Should I wait more? Should I take a bus to Portland and enjoy a few days off? Should I just skip the next 150 miles (I need to find a ride)?</p>
<p>I spent the afternoon listening to music, podcasts, audio books, drinking beer (non-alcoholic) and doing absolutely nothing else. I know Clara (who started the PCT with me) is arriving here in Cascade Locks tomorrow. I’ll wait and discuss the situation with her and her group.</p>
<p>Now, time to watch some Olympics…</p>

<p>Mile 2137.8 to Cascade Locks</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 11.5 (18.4km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 2149.3 (3438.9km)</p>
<p>The morning was a breeze: 10 miles of pure downhill into Cascade Locks! I was able to arrive before the post office opened at 8:30am!</p>
<p>I successfully got my packages containing 75% of all the food I’ll need for the Washigton section. Two items that I was very looking forward were also in the boxes: flip flops and my stove!! Cold soaking never again!</p>
<p>My plan is to spend the day today sorting everything into small boxes and send four resupply packages ahead. All of that before the post office closes again, at 5am.</p>
<p>On top of that, I needed to take a 30 minutes bus to another town (Hood River) to buy socks and fleece pants (I’m a bit afraid of getting too cold during the nights in Washington). To be able to plan things properly, I needed mind fuel. I stopped for a healthy breakfast before executing my plan: grilled cheese, fries and peanut butter milkshake.</p>
<p>After eating, I needed a room to do all the resupply sorting so I went to the cheapest inn in town. I was able to get an affordable room and check in at 9:30am! Great! Now, the plan was to go to Hood River, buy the equipment and the rest of the food, pack at least the first two resupply boxes and send them today. And leave the other two packages to send tomorrow. The clock was ticking!</p>
<p>My search for socks and fleece pants was successful and so was the groceries run. At 4:30 I  was back at the post office in Cascade Locks just in time to send my boxes to the next two resupply towns: Trout Lake and White Pass! Check ✅!</p>
<p>On the way back to the hotel from the post office I meet some not-so-happy-looking hikers. They quickly shared the news: in the past hour a new fire started, closing the trail from Trout Lake to White Pass. That’s right: this new trail closure starts and ends literally where I had sent my packages to, just a few minutes ago.</p>
<p>The news completely destroyed my mood. I went to a brewery to have a burger (and my third portion of fries of the day) and a local non-alcoholic beer. After that I went back to the hotel and organized the last two boxes and don’t even want to think about another re-route. For now, I’ll just assume that the plan stays the same and that I’ll be leaving tomorrow morning. Let’s see!</p>

<p>Another day on trail, another day of trail magic! This time it was just this guy who hiked the PCT a while ago and now he’s retired and does trail magic in different parts of the PCT every year. He said his favorite part is when there’s a heatwave and he brings ice cream to the hikers. They go crazy, he said.</p>
<p>Lots of fresh fruits and vegetables later, I continued my day. The plan was to get as close as I could from Cascade Locks, where I have my resupply package waiting for me. Hopefully I will be able to sort all my food for Washington and send 4-5 packages tomorrow still. If that works, I won’t take a zero in Cascade Locks!</p>
<p>The highlight of the day and certainly one of the highlights of the whole trail was Tunnel Falls, on an alternate route that I had to take due a fire closure. This alternate (Eagle Creek Trail) is widely more used than the official PCT path for this section, because the Eagle Creek Trail is so scenic and you can see the Tunnel Falls, this majestic waterfall where you hike behind the falling water through a cold and dark tunnel. It’s absolutely splendid.</p>
<p>Earlier, still in the morning, I crossed paths with a girl who stopped me to ask if I was a PCT thru hiker. I said yes and then she told me that it’s her dream: that one day she would also thru hike the PCT. She looked me in the eye and said “Thru hiking the PCT? it’s a gift, dude. It’s a gift”.</p>

<p>There was nothing else on my mind today other than “buffet lunch at Timberline Lodge”!</p>
<p>Lunch starts being served at 12 and I had easy 10 miles to do in the morning. It was a fairly steep uphill but I was fueled by the excitement to have unlimited fresh and warm food. I arrived at the lodge at 10:30 and had more than enough time to chill and charge my electronics.</p>
<p>The trail was packed with day hikers and tourists. To be honest, it seemed a very nice place to spend a Sunday or a weekend. There were so many families and people of all ages hiking, mountain biking, taking photographs and observing nature with binoculars. I’m not sure all of them understood why some of the hikers (like me) looked so dirty and worn out 🙃.</p>
<p>At 12 on the dot me with a group of other 6 hikers (only one, Andrew, that I already knew) sat on a table and started our little gluttony party. Again, I’m sure our collective smelliness caught some undesired attention from non-thru hikers at the restaurant. On our table, there were piles of meat on the plates of the meat eaters. I had six plates two beers and two beers in front of me. Finally I feel moderately full!</p>
<p>I was expecting a bit more of variety but honestly I can’t complain. I had lots of fresh salad and vegetables, which is luxury on the PCT. I ended up spending five and a half hours at the lodge, charging, resting, calling Maike 💜 and I also left almost all my food on the hiker box. I have now with me only the minimum for dinner tonight (tortilla with nutella) and food for tomorrow. I want to arrive in Cascade Locks (44.2 miles ahead of me) for breakfast on Tuesday🤞!</p>
<p>I hiked just for two more hours and found a cute little spot to camp amongst wildflowers 🌺.</p>

<p>It was a very pleasant night with good temperatures and no condensation in the morning.</p>
<p>Right after I left camp I heard something moving on the bushes to my right. Clearly the bear had seen me first and it was already running to the opposite direction. I could only have a glance of its black furred butt and that was it!</p>
<p>After 16 miles, at lunch time — I was ready to eat my 700-calories-lunch-energy-bar-that-I’m-very-fed-up-with — my prayers were heard: there was a trail magic ahead!</p>
<p>I forgot to ask the name of today’s trail angel, but this is what she does: for the past 4 years, every year, she goes camping for about two weeks with her horses on a horse camp (yes, this exists) which is on a very short side trail from the PCT. She brings food for herself, hay for the horses and tons of foods and drinks for the PCT hikers!</p>
<p>I had cheese sandwiches, cookies and chips. It was good to eat something savory other than almonds or my cold-soaked dinners. I ate enough so I could skip dinner tonight (I can’t with my food anymore 😭).</p>
<p>Having to hike still 13 miles to the camp site, at some point I had to stop eating and continue hiking. Another uneventful afternoon followed and I made camp early, around 6:30pm. For dinner I had wrap with nutella, freeze-dried strawberries and almonds. It was delicious!</p>
<p>Tomorrow we feast!</p>

<p>I spent almost the whole day today hiking on burnt forests. Not fun, specially when the sun and high temperatures are back.</p>
<p>I had to do something regarding my food. My day food is not the best, but it’s ok (mainly bars and nuts). On the other hand, I’m not enjoying my cold dinners at all. I took a tiny detour today to stop by a resort that had a small shop to see how I could improve my food situation.</p>
<p>Tortillas and nutella, that was the solution that I could come up with given the limited options that I had. I’ve just had dinner now: the same cold soaked cucumbers, tomato, cabbage and seeds salad but this time wrapped in a tortilla with some almonds. I must say that it tasted much better than the salad alone. And for desert I had tortilla with nutella, which has absolutely no problem being served cold.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is Saturday (a good day for trail magic) and I heard that it’s common to have trail magic in this area. I’m hopping I can find an option to skip one more day of eating cold soaked food (in</p>
<p>other words: that I find trail magic). And the day after tomorrow… buffet lunch at Timberline Lodge 🤩!</p>

<p>I still can’t believe on the low amount of mosquitoes that I’ve faced here in Oregon so far. I still have a few days around here so they might be preparing a sneak attack. But let’s keep our hopes high that they just won’t show up!</p>
<p>The hiking in the morning was very pleasant, with views of at least five beautiful lakes. I can’t say the same about the afternoon, where the astonishing landscape was replaced by miles and miles of burnt trees.</p>
<p>Not much else to share. I crossed paths with a few southbounders today, some thru hikers, some day hikers. Weather went up again so even though I’m staying in a horrible camp site tonight, I hope I can sleep better than the past chilly nights.</p>

<p>Once more I put the rain fly over the tent “just because” and I was glad I did: in the morning all my stuff were full of condensation (sleeping quilt and backpack were the worse) and I was a bit cold. Breaking out camp is always less pleasant when everything you touch is cold and wet.</p>
<p>I had a resupply box waiting for me in 17 miles, at the Big Lake Youth Camp. I also had heard that they’re super hiker friendly, offering a free space for us to rest, shower, do laundry and even get meals! All donation-based.</p>
<p>I arrived at BLYC 1pm which was exactly lunch time! I had my fair share of cheese tostis with tomato soup 🥪🥫and after that I took care of my chores, including drying up my tent and sleeping quilt, still wet from last night. During my afternoon at BLYC, amongst new and familiar faces I saw Rocky (from days 54 and 72), DIY, Free Mile and Soybean. I also met a few other hikers that I hadn’t seen before.</p>
<p>I don’t know exactly how but all of a sudden it was 6:20pm already and that means dinner time! Tortilla chips which beans, cheese, lettuce and tomato 🌮🫘🧀🥬🍅. Delicious!</p>
<p>But the day wasn’t over yet: I didn’t want to stay. I wanted to avoid the risk of being vortexed (tomorrow they serve breakfast at 8:20am, which is too late but I’m sure I’ll wait for it if I stay here tonight). I gathered my last bits of energy and hiked two miles north and found a camping spot.</p>
<p>Fully loaded with snacks and supplies, my next big stop (if everything goes according to the plan, of course), is a all-you-can-eat lunch buffet at Timberline Lodge (google it!), 103 miles ahead. I’ll try to crush 30 miles a day for the next three days and arrive at Timberline Lodge in time for a one in a lifetime Sunday lunch!</p>

<p>For the past two nights I’ve been setting my tent up with the rain fly, so it serves as a barrier against the chilly wind. Therefore I was accidentally prepared for the rain that fell this past night.</p>
<p>In the morning the rain had stopped but I left camp wearing my rain pants and jacket, not against the rain but against the mosquitoes. To be fair there were very few in the morning, but I was sure it was going to get worse during the day. It didn’t.</p>
<p>Hiking was chill, with good weather and improving smoke situation. The water sources today were much better than the past days and surprisingly still very few mosquitoes!</p>
<p>Tomorrow I will get my second and last package here in Oregon. I’m not sure what to do: I’m getting really sick of my Oregon cold food. I can’t wait to have my stove back!</p>

<p>Smoke-wise the day started much better than it ended yesterday. If you were persistent, you could even spot a blue sky!</p>
<p>An old friend (or horde of friends) that have slowly showing up are the mosquitoes. To be honest I expected it to be worse (knock knock knock ✊🪵), but even a few mosquitoes are enough to ruin a day.  In the morning I hiked mostly covered with my rain gear and mosquito net. Gladly it hasn’t been warm in the past days.</p>
<p>Around lunchtime I crossed paths with a southbounder and he told me that I had a fun surprise ahead. Usually that means one thing: trail magic!</p>
<p>And indeed, instead of energy bars, I had hot dogs, chips and iced tea for lunch! The trail angels, Ducky’s Mom and Ducky’s Dad, started trail angeling when their son (Ducky, of course) finished his PCT and urged them to become trail angels (they live relatively close to the PCT). Ducky’s Mom and Ducky’s Dad have been doing this now every year since 2016!</p>
<p>Once again I couldn’t stay as much as I wanted and needed to keep going after 40 minutes. Even though I had hiked already 13 miles (21km) in the morning I still had another 23 miles (37km) to hike!</p>
<p>The afternoon was very uneventful, but mostly not pleasant. Smoke, mosquitoes and burned areas took turns into making me company. I kept a good pace and since it wasn’t hot today I didn’t need to filter and drink so much water.</p>
<p>I’m having intense weeks with a lot of 30+ miles days and although my legs feel great, my feet are starting to hurt a little. I hope everything stays in place for a bit more, since my next planned zero is in about eight days.</p>

<p>Mile 1907.6 to mile 1912.5 (skipped from mile 1848.8 to mile 1907.6 (58.8 miles) due official PCT wildfire-related closures: Middle Fork Fire, Trail Fire and Diamond Peak Fire)</p>

<p>Total Miles: 1912.5 (3060.0km)</p>
<p>Gladly at 11am Free Mile showed up with Soybean and Lucky and even better our ride also showed up! During the car ride I was very sleepy and barely remember a thing. It took us around 1 and a half hour to arrive at Shelter Cove Resort. There was smoke everywhere.</p>
<p>I got my resupply box that I sent to myself back in Ashland (day 98), ate a burger with double fries, drank liters of water and charged my devices. Besides having a snack bar with burgers, pizzas and burritos, Shelter Cove also offers free camping for PCT hikers. The temptation to take the rest of the day off was building up.</p>
<p>But I wanted to keep hiking. Today marks the start of my fourth week without taking a single zero! I bought myself a pint of Ben &#x26; Jerry and decided that I was going to leave as soon as I finished it. At 4:20pm I was on the road hiking 1.5 mile back to rejoin the PCT!</p>
<p>From the moment I left the car in Shelter Cove until now (8pm), I can not only smell the smoke but also feel it in my eyes and throat. I don’t think I’ve ever been exposed to such amount of smoke for so much time. I hope tomorrow I can hike away from this unpleasant smoke.</p>
<p>The five miles hike from Shelter Cove to tonight’s campsite was very chill. There was the smoke, of course, but at least it was not hot and the views were beautiful. I’m camping tonight between two lakes in one of the most beautiful campsites I had so far. I hope it doesn’t get <em>too</em> cold during the night 🥶.</p>

<p>Mile 1811.9 to mile 1840.3</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 28.4 (45.4km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 1840.3 (2944.5km)</p>
<p>Around midnight a deer 🦌 started to wander around my tent. They’re known to come at night to lick 👅 or chew on your trekking poles handles or backpack straps). I tried to send them away a few times but at some point I just gave up and sent back to sleep. My stuff seemed untouched in the morning.</p>
<p>When I finally woke up I was a bit in bad mood. My Garmin was acting a bit weird and I was anxious about the fire ahead: the only info I had was from this random girl at the trail magic two days ago who told me that the PCT would be closed earlier than we were expecting: at mile 1824, at the junction with the Crater Lake Rim Trail.</p>
<p>Instructions were unclear, so I hiked fast in the morning. On the way I met Bilbo, English 26-years old dude. I had never seen him before. We hiked together for about one hour and we chatted during that time. Or, better said, Bilbo chatted with me. He told me about his life back in England, his time in the army, how he wanted to be deployed in Iraq during covid, his misfortunes with women and jobs and his aspirations to become a paramedic. He told me a lot.</p>
<p>He exited the trail earlier, afraid that the trail would be closed ahead and we would have to turn around and go back.</p>
<p>The trail was indeed closed at mile 1824.0 but I the alternative was to take the Crater Lake Rim Trail, which I did, arriving at the restaurant at Crater Lake Park parking lot at 11am. I was so looking forward for having breakfast AND lunch there. Unfortunately the kitchen was closed and I got fries with cheese and pre-packed salad 😐. I had free refills of tea and coffee though.</p>
<p>I stayed there for three hours charging my devices, drinking 3 liters of tea and almost 2 of coffee, using the amazing miracle that are flush toilets 🚽. Most importantly, I was trying to figure out a plan to go around the fire and arrive at Shelter Cove (80 miles ahead) tomorrow. My resupply package is there and I currently have less than one day of food.</p>
<p>The Rim Trail was actually very beautiful and enjoyable to hike for the first few miles. After that though the smoke started to thicken and I could feel the smoke on my sore eyes and throat. Not much I could do at this point, I kept hiking.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile I got a message from Free Mile, a hiker that I’ve been leapfrogging with and to whom I talked to at the Crater Lake “Restaurant”. He said he had secured a ride for us tomorrow at noon from highway 138 (8 miles from where I’m camping tonight) to Shelter Cove. Awesome!</p>
<p>The trail from tonight’s campsite to highway 138 is actually closed, as part of the same closure from earlier today. To get there, we will do a 8 miles road walk, parallel to the PCT.</p>
<p>Arrived early at camp and the air quality here seems ok. On my way here I rationed my snacks and I only ate half of my dinner tonight, just in case. For tomorrow, until I get to Shelter Cove, I have half a dinner and three snack bars (which should be more than enough).</p>

<p>Total Miles: 1848.8 (2958.1km)</p>
<p>This past night I had one of the coldest night experiences here on the PCT. Not only because it went below freezing, but mainly because I’m not bringing warmer clothes for this part of the trail. Well, it happens.</p>
<p>I had agreed with Free Mile to meet at highway 138 at noon. He would leave earlier to go back a few miles and have breakfast with Soybean, his wife, with a view to the Crater Lake. I started hiking a bit after 6 and soon reached the road, where I would hike for the next 8 miles.</p>
<p>To be honest it was not that bad. It took a while for the sun to warm me up but the views were beautiful and it was too early for the roads to be busy with cars. After eating all my remaining snack bars along the way, I arrived at the meeting point at 9:30am.</p>
<p>For breakfast, I just had the half that I saved from my dinner yesterday at the best hikertrash style, by the roadside. Now I’m 100% without food, so I hope Free Mile (and specially our ride) really show up 😬!</p>

<p>Except for the hiker i overtake that was reading a book <em>while</em> hiking, absolutely nothing out of the ordinary happened today. So I’ll write about the next trail closure (which is 12 miles ahead of me) and my plan for tomorrow.</p>
<p>When I left Ashland, I knew that the Trail Fire plus some other fires around Diamond Peak Wilderness forced the PCT to be closed from mile 1848.8 to 1907.2. But yesterday I heard that the closure starts now at mile 1824.0.</p>
<p>I don’t have internet to check any of that, but on my map it seems that I can circumvent this closure by doing the alternate on the Crater Rim Trail (which I would do anyway). I believe the vast majority of PCTers do the rim trail alternate.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I’ll go fast in the morning to arrive at Crater Lake’s cafe (15 miles away) before noon and get more information about the closures. I only have one more day of food, so I need to find a way to get to the end of the closure (mile 1907.2) where my resupply package hopefully awaits for me.</p>

<p>I started hiking a little bit later than I wanted today: the morning was chilly and my thermometer was showing 5 degrees celsius. I wasn’t expecting any of my nights here in Oregon to be that cold. Gladly my sleeping quilt (and not bag) did a good job 👍.</p>
<p>I’m trying to take advantage of the fact that Oregon is relatively flat to crush miles. Water is still more scarce than I imagined, but this actually helps since I stop less often to filter water (but I have longer and heavier water carries).</p>
<p>By 2pm I had already hiked 20 miles in a very uneventful morning. I was carrying 3 liters of water for the next 18 miles when I crossed paths with two southbounders smiling at me: “you have trail magic ahead!”. These are the words that every thru hiker loves to hear.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later there was it: trail angels had set a big tent with food and chairs. There were hammocks and games to play. They were making burgers 🍔! I had two. And chips. And cookies. And cinnamon roll. And blueberry muffin 🫐🧁 . And cantaloupes🍈 . And watermelon 🍉. And cherries 🍒. And strawberries 🍓.</p>
<p>All of that in 40 minutes: I kept an eye on my watch. I didn’t want to be vortexed and miss my goal of 35 miles for today. I thanked the trail angels but it was time to go (with a very full belly).</p>
<p>An uneventful afternoon followed. The weather today was much better than the past days, so it was pleasant to hike, without sweating too much and having to drink (and carry) lots of water.</p>
<p>I arrived at camp at ten past eight. I made my cold soaked dinner, pitched my tent and observed the deers around the campsite. As I’m writing this (it’s 9:30pm) I can hear the deers walking around and getting closer to my tent. I know they like to lick the salt on hikers teaming poles handles. Well, I hope I can ignore them and sleep well 🙃!</p>

<p>I really enjoyed staying at The Columbia Hotel! So far, my favorite place to stay on the PCT! Jay, I wish all the success to your business! Thank you for picking me up and dropping me off at the trailhead!</p>
<p>In the morning I went to two different coffee shops before Jay would drop me off at 9am. I had a nice avocado toast for breakfast and I was ready to start the next section of the PCT!</p>
<p>Hiking was chill without surprises. It’s much less warm than the previous days and the path was very mild elevation-wise. Even though I started hiking after 9:30am, by 6pm I was already at the campsite, 22.6 miles ahead! Good out-of-town day!</p>
<p>My backpack has never been so light when leaving  town after resupplying. I’m bringing food for only 4 days and I hope to grab my package with more food on the fifth day. Tonight was also my first time cold soaking and I must say that I enjoyed my dinner very much (which is good, because I have the same dinner for the coming 12 nights!).</p>
<p>My plan is to hike Oregon as fast as I can. I want to finish hiking in Oregon in less than two weeks and finally take a zero in Cascade Locks (where I sent all my stuff to), just across the river from Washington (the last state of the PCT).</p>

<p>Mile 1713.5 to Ashland</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 6.2 (9.9km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 1719.7 (2751.5km)</p>
<p>It’s town day! Going downhill, backpack as light as it can be, beautiful morning and feeling rested after sleeping for almost ten hours!</p>
<p>I had internet yesterday at camp, so I could arrange a ride with the hotel I’ll stay at tonight: it’s a new hotel and word on trail is that it’s a cool one and most importantly, hiker friendly.</p>
<p>I arrived at the trailhead at 8am and waited for one hour until Jay showed up on this gigantic car. Air conditioning blasting, I almost froze during our 25 minutes ride to Ashland. On the way, Jay, who owns the hotel, told me more about it.</p>
<p>She recently bought and renovated this hotel, moved to Ashland last December and opened it in April this year: it’s her first hiking season! Since my room was already free, she let me check in at 10am and I could finally, after one week, shower. My body was completely covered in dust, salt and ash.</p>
<p>I loved this place! The Columbia Hotel! It’s fully decorated with local artists paintings 🖼️ that are all on sale. They have local DJs playing every now and then and the rooms and common spaces look beautiful. It’s almost calling me to take a zero…</p>

<p>After taking a shower, time to collect all my packages. I had a few at the hotel and a few more to collect at the post office 🏤. I got all these packages because I have an ambitious plan for all the remaining resupplies!</p>
<p>On day 90, at the post office in Old Station, I met Diesel and Red Lentils and I was amused by their resupply strategy: they had a gigantic box with basically all the food they will need for the whole PCT. They send this box to themselves from time to time and when they receive it (like now), they prepare the 2-3 next resupply boxes and send this big box further away and when they reach there, they repeat the process. By doing that, they “do groceries” much quicker and easier and still give them a lot of flexibility.</p>
<p>So that’s what I’m doing here today! I bought 30+ dinner packs, 200+ energy bars and absurd amounts of electrolytes, wet wipes and other amenities and made myself three boxes: two resupply boxes for Oregon and one box with everything else that I sent to the last town in Oregon, 400+ miles away: Cascade Locks. “Everything else” includes my mattress, fleece, puff jacket, extra sock, old shoes (that might be useful still) and, notably, my stove and cooking pot!</p>
<p>In order to reduce time spent with anything other than hiking and to make things simpler, I’ll hike through Oregon stoveless. That means I will cold soak 🫙 my food instead of cooking them. Other than (cold) dinner, all my other meals will be composed by bars or other foods that I can eat while walking! I sent ahead my warm clothes, sleeping mattress and now my warm food… I feel that I’m little by little removing all the pleasures from my life 😂!</p>
<p>Before closing the boxes, I went to the supermarket to buy more bars and nuts to put in them. The post office closed at 5pm and I was there at 4:50pm! Mission accomplished ✅!</p>

<p>After 100 days in California, I finally crossed the state line today and I’m now in Oregon!</p>
<p>I was a bit apprehensive because a few days ago there was a fire (Donomore fire) at the border and some people had to take a road alternate. Luckily there was no signs of fire or detour, so I just kept hiking the PCT.</p>
<p>I saw some cows today and I must say that I was very glad that they had cowbells to announce their presence before you could actually see them. I like cows 🐮🫶.</p>
<p>Starting tomorrow I will cold soak my food for the coming two weeks. That means that I’m going to use cold water to prepare (soak) the food instead of cooking it. For ramen, for example, you put the noodles and cold water in a jar 🫙, close it and leave for 1-2 hours and voilá! You have dinner!</p>
<p>Because of that, tomorrow I’m also going to send my stove by post to the last town in Oregon (or the first in Washington — I’m not sure yet). Tonight I cooked my last dinner and I was wondering what I would do with my gas canister, which was almost full and you can’t mail a gas canister.</p>
<p>Right after I ate, I heard some gas leaking on the campsite next to me and a man that I had never seen before, Compass, told me that his gas canister broke and he had just started going southbound to Seiyad Valley (exactly the opposite of what I did in the past days). He asked if I didn’t have an extra gas canister by any chance… what are the odds?</p>

<p>I was not exactly expecting so much elevation gain today, but the trail leaving Seiad Valley is super steep. It was a tough day: it felt like I was hiking uphill all the time. My watch says I climbed the equivalent of 412 stairs today and it was the day that I burned more calories ever (5478 kcal)!</p>
<p>For the whole day I could see the smoke in the horizon. I must say that I enjoyed the view, but it’s kind of scary to realize that something is burning so close and the air quality is far from ideal. The more I hiked (further and up), the better it became to breathe.</p>
<p>Water is getting a little bit tricky to get. I refilled my water three times today, all of them in very trickly streams. Well, at least there is water and I never needed to carry more than 3 liters at once.</p>
<p>The positive side of all the elevation gain is that it’s much cooler now. The past night was so warm that it was difficult for me to sleep. I have a feeling that tonight I’ll sleep very well 🥱.</p>

<p>(I’m skipping 155.3 miles today (Shelly fire 🖕). For simplicity’s sake I’ll add those miles to the total miles.)</p>
<p>The drive to Seiad Valley was longer than I thought and after picking up the hiker (it was 40 Count, a hiker that a met recently!) we drove for almost 3 hours to arrive. It was insanely hot, so I took a break until 6pm inside the general store (which basically IS Seiad Valley) with 40 Count and Speedy (she was there already when we arrived).</p>
<p>At 6pm, still very warm and hazy 🌫️ because of all the smoke coming from Shelly Fire (🖕), the three of us started hiking very slowly (it’s a big uphill climb to leave the valley). After only 1.2 miles both me and Speedy called it a day and 40 Count kept hiking up.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>About Shelly fire (🖕):</p>
<p>Almost three weeks ago, part of the PCT was closed around mile 1600, because there’s a wildfire burning exactly where the trail is. Most of the alternates to go around the fire by foot are not allowed or are not very smart.</p>
<p>In order to keep my two main rules alive (1. Don’t die; 2. Make wise decisions), I decided to leave the trail before getting too close to the fire.</p>
<p>The highway to Mount Shasta that I took this morning is 100 miles before the PCT closure, but it’s the more correct place to exit the PCT: if you hike further, you’ll need that someone picks you up in a dirt or service road and run the risk of being on the way of firemen 👨‍🚒 that really need to use those roads.</p>
<p>I struggled a bit in the beginning with the fact that I’m finally breaking my continuous footpath from Mexico to Canada, but it’s a no-brainer that I have to do it. I already accepted the idea and I’m fine with it. I’m now hoping that this is the only fire that I need to dodge from (I don’t think it will be 😞).</p>
<p>If everything goes well and the stars align, there’s also the possibility for me to come back here after (if) I reach Canada and hike this missing part. Time will tell.</p>

<p>Before sleeping yesterday, I had internet connection so I could successfully arrange a ride to Mount Shasta at 8am today. This is the first step in order to go around the fire. The next one is to find a more difficult ride: from Mount Shasta to Seiad Valley.</p>
<p>With that, I’m officially skipping my first PCT miles: 155.3 miles in total. Shelly fire, this is for you 🖕!</p>
<p>I arrived at the trailhead at 7:20am and my ride was already there. Doc told me he does this for a few years now and last year alone he gave rides for more than 1400 hikers!</p>
<p>He also had cookies, bananas and chips. Doritos for pre-breakfast? Why not?</p>
<p>We waited twenty minutes for a group of hikers that Doc was also going to bring to town. Everything was ahead of schedule and by 8am I was already ordering my mushroom breakfast burrito with peanut butter latte in town. I devoured my food while charging my devices!</p>
<p>While charging, I was lucky enough to find another trail angel on the internet, Beth, who was going to pickup a hiker on a trailhead further north and bring to Seiad Valley — exactly where I wanted to be! She agreed to pick me up at 1pm, so I had a few hours to kill in Mount Shasta. I went to a nice coffee shop, updated myself about the wildfires around, uploaded the last Polarsteps posts and had a whole pint of Ben and Jerry’s!</p>

<p>Today was a good hiking day. Since leaving camp at 5:45 I kept a good pace. The trail was mostly flat and it’s much more enjoyable to hike early in the morning, before the sun shows up with full power.</p>
<p>My first real break was around noon, after having crushed 17 miles already. I took a 45 minute lunch break and then kept going for one and a half hour more. Time for another break (with trail angel candies) and to camel up 🐫🆙 for the next stretch: 10 miles uphill in the hottest time of the day.</p>
<p>At least here the trees 🌲 still have their leaves and they provided good shade. I kept more or less the same pace until I arrived at camp around 7:30pm after hiking 52km today!</p>

<p>From waking up to trail in 20 minutes, I started the day in a good rhythm.</p>
<p>It’s still very hot and I need to always be vigilant with my water: everyday I need to make sure that I know where I’m going to refill my water and figure out how much water I want to carry from one source to the next.</p>
<p>My golden rule so far is 1 liter of water every 4 miles. If the next source is 10 miles away, I pack 2.5 liters of water. Easy.</p>
<p>Because I’m hiking a bit faster now, I’m changing that rule to be 1 liter every 6 miles, specially if it’s not scalding hot. If it’s hot and there’s no shades, I do 1 liter every 3-4 miles.</p>
<p>I don’t know exactly how, but around lunch time, right after refilling my water (2 liters for the next 12.5 miles under the sun) I stopped to take some pictures of Mount Shasta and continued to hike. Half an hour later (about 1.2 miles) I see a hiker that I was sure was behind me coming on the opposite direction. I knew already what had happened:</p>
<p>“I’m going back, aren’t I?” I asked the other hiker. “Yup” was the obvious answer.</p>
<p>I lost a whole hour, hiked 2.4 miles for absolutely nothing and the worst: now I had to hike almost 15 miles with 2 liters of water only and at the warmest time of the day. Great 🙂‍↔️!</p>
<p>In the end everything went well. I’m managed my water very carefully and when I finally arrived at the source, the water was fresh and cold, so it felt like a prize 🏆.</p>
<p>In this part of the PCT there are deers everywhere and they absolutely don’t care about us. I crossed a few on trail today and right now there’s one here at the campsite, acting like he’s the campsite patrol 🏕️🦌👮.</p>

<p>Burney Mountain Guest Ranch to mile 1435.7</p>
<p>PCT Miles:  24.9 (39.8km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 1435.7 (2297.1km)</p>
<p>What a lovely place! The Burney Mountain Guest Ranch was my favorite place to stay during the PCT so far!</p>
<p>We had waffles and potatoes and eggs and hash browns for breakfast and after some resistance from my body (who really wanted to stay and take a zero 0️⃣) I left BMGR a bit before 10am.</p>
<p>I then hiked 15 miles in exactly 5 hours (a super good pace!) and took a nice lunch break by a river, under a bridge (shade!). I initially had planned to hike only 15 miles today, but since I was feeling good, I kept hiking for five miles more until I found an awesome camping spot!</p>

<p>Mile 1385.8 to Burney Mountain Guest Ranch</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 25.0 (40.0km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 1410.8 (2257.3km)</p>
<p>The word on trail was that 25 miles ahead there’s a new guest ranch where the owners are super hiker friendly and they have a salt water pool 🏊‍♂️  plus homemade style dinner and breakfast. I wanted to check it out, but since I’m not taking a zero, I had to speed up so I could arrive there in time to enjoy all the things.</p>
<p>I started the day at 5:30am and hiked the 25 miles almost non-stop for 9 hours, only pausing to filter water once. By 2:30pm I was at the Burney Mountain Guest Ranch and at 3pm I was eating pizza and having a cold drink!</p>
<p>After 10 days I’m finally taking a shower and doing laundry! I also had plenty of time to enjoy the salt water pool and order my next resupplies to Ashland (I’ll write a post explaining my next resupply strategy when I’m there) and I’m sleeping on a bunk bed tonight 🛌! There are six other hikers staying here this night. For dinner we had burgers and tons of fresh salad and I already can’t wait for breakfast tomorrow!</p>

<p>Total Miles: 1385.8 (2217.3km)</p>
<p>Nothing like a swim in the river and “clean” clothes to make you sleep well. Yesterday I was ready to sleep at 7pm but I forced myself to stay awake until 8. Then I slept like a stone until 5:30.</p>
<p>I arrived in Old Station at 7:30 and found exactly what I was looking for: a power outlet and internet connection! Now I had what to do until the general store opened (at 9). The post office opens at 11.</p>
<p>There was only one cliff bar left of all my food. I was starving (and very happy that my food lasted exactly what it needed to last). I was the first customer at the general store (and at the post office too). For breakfast I had two frozen burritos (microwaved at the store), two ice cream sandwiches, a big cup of coffee and a six pack of beer. I love this day already!</p>
<p>When the post office opened and I asked for</p>
<p>my package, Renée, the awesome clerk who works there, told me that she was wondering whose this package was, because it was so colorful. Artwork from Maike and Jessica 💜!</p>
<p>I was very happy that my box was there. Now, I have food for 8-9 days again! My initial plan was to go to Etna (225 miles away), but the town is under evacuation because of a wildfire.</p>
<p>After mile 1600 there’s a part of the PCT that is closed (and will mos likely be closed for the entire year since the Shelly fire literally crosses the PCT). I still need to figure out what I’m going to do, but I’ll do that later. At least for the coming five days I’m far away from the fire, so I don’t need to decide now.</p>
<p>In any case, today I sent my inflatable sleeping mattress and my extra clothes to Ashland, Oregon. I haven’t been using them since last week and with this heat I doubt I will. Now I sleep using the sleeping pad only and my only extra clothes are 1 pair of socks and 1 puff jacket!</p>
<p>I liked the idea of mailing myself a resupply</p>
<p>box so much that I’m brewing a plan in my mind to mail myself all the remaining food for the PCT once I’m in Ashland in around 10 days. Let me think more about this and I’ll share here soon!</p>

<p>From waking up to hiking in 20 minutes!</p>
<p>Still a lot of dead trees. It was cloudy for almost the whole day. The path was flat and mega easy to hike.</p>
<p>With the overcast, the breaks to filter water also become quicker since I don’t need to drink so much. I listened to music or podcasts all day long.</p>
<p>I’m camped in this best camping spot since a while already. There’s a creek and there’s a great spot to swim (did already ✅). I arrived at camp at 4pm and had plenty of time to stretch, swim, cook, wash and dry my shirt, filter water and just chill.</p>
<p>Tomorrow the post office opens at 11am and the General Store at 9am. I’m 4 miles away from Old Station so I should be there by 8am. The plan is to get my box, recharge my devices a bit, hopefully have internet to get more info about the wildfires ahead and move on!</p>

<p>Not much has happened in the morning. I’ve been trying to shorten the time between waking up and start hiking. This morning it took me a bit over 20 minutes.</p>
<p>I crossed paths again with Sprouts, Banana Bread and 40 Count — the three of them trying to hitch to town. I’m skipping this town (Chester) and instead I’ll get (hopefully 😬) my package that I sent to myself in the next town, Old Station!</p>
<p>I had a wonderful lunch break by the river. I knew I would have a “short” day today (around 23 miles) so took my time and soaked my feet in the cold water and scrubbed the dirt and all the ash off. My socks were so dirty and full of salt from feet sweat that they were stiff. It was actually hurting a bit as if I was wearing wooden socks. I vigorously washed them (in this heat and sun, they dried up in 20 minutes) and spent two hours chilling and eating my last portion of disgusting olivranola. I can’t wait for my package with more variety of food 🥴.</p>
<p>Soon after my break some clouds started to show up (I don’t think I’ve seen clouds since I restarted the PCT) and it made the afternoon hike much more pleasant. I ended up my hiking day at 4:30 and for the first time in a long time I had time to stretch and enjoy some chill time between dinner and writing polarsteps/going to sleep. Now it’s actually pretty busy here at the camp site. There are at least 9 other hikers camping here tonight ☺️.</p>

<p>The most interesting part of my whole morning was stopping to camel up and fill to all my water capacity (currently 4 liters) for the shadeless and waterless stretch ahead. The spring was very convenient 😊.</p>
<p>Around 12:30 the sun started to get really hot. I was halfway to a water spring (which was 15 minutes off trail) and I had just enough (lukewarm) water to make it to the spring. And then.</p>
<p>Trail magic 🪄!</p>
<p>Free fresh food and cold drinks. Differently from the usual trail magic, there were no cliff bars or m&#x26;ms or junk food in general. There were actually a lot of homemade food! Potato salad, fruit salad, home baked cookies, muffins, sandwiches. Fresh fruit and vegetables from one of the trail angel’s garden. All there absolutely for free for thru hikers to satisfy their hunger. It was the best trail magic I’ve experienced so far.</p>
<p>After almost three hours eating cantaloupes and watermelons and cherries and strawberries and apples and bananas and peaches and blueberries and raspberries and grapes and kiwis and pineapples — seriously! all those fruits! — plus cookies, muffins and a sandwich or two, I cameled up for the coming 17 miles without water (and dry camping tonight). The rest of the afternoon was hot, but not as much as the previous days.</p>
<p>Right before my camp site for tonight, I passed the PCT midpoint mark 🎉! It took me almost three months to do the first half. I want to finish the second half in less than two months! Cheers 🥂!</p>
<p>There were a lot more of forests of dead trees today (and I think it will continue for a few days still). I learned that these black dead trees are called widowmakers. I’m actually camping tonight surrounded by them and it’s really creepy and a bit frightening how they indeed creek and squeak. And sometimes you hear branches falling out of the blue. Tonight I’m happy that it’s not windy 😮‍💨.</p>

<p>Once again, beautiful sunrise!</p>
<p>My next chance to find a quick resupply was Belden, twenty miles away. It’s located literally on the PCT and it looks tiny. Hopefully I would be able to buy a few snacks to top up my food for the coming 3 days.</p>
<p>I went on auto-pilot and before 1:30pm I was in Belden Town. It’s a street with 5 wooden houses and a big building containing a general store, a simple restaurant (!) and a hotel. Everybody is super hiker friendly and, most importantly, they had air conditioning!</p>
<p>After eating a burger with fries and five beers* I resupplied with snickers and two gigantic packs of cookies. Hopefully I have just the right amount of food now! I also recharged a bit my power bank and posted here on Polarsteps 🙃.</p>
<p>Two and a half hours after arriving I left Belden. It’s the first time (I think) that I do this on the PCT: arrive, resupply/eat and leave (without spending the night). I’m on a mission!</p>
<p>The next 8 miles were under a scorching sun and very uphill. I drank 6 liters of water within the first hour but steady and slowly I made it to camp.</p>
<p>In Belden I saw Sprouts, a Canadian girl who I met at Scout and Frodo and started the PCT on the same day as me. She has just arrived with Banana Bread (a guy from New Zealand who speaks Portuguese) to share the campground. The three</p>
<p>of us chatted a bit and updated each other on the current stage of the members of our first group!</p>
<p>*: all the beers I’ve been drinking on the PCT are non-alcoholic. I’m not drinking alcohol on this trip!</p>

<p>I’m getting really good at packing up in the morning.  It took me 25 minutes today from waking up to be hiking (from 5:20 to 5:45)!</p>
<p>During the day I realized that there was a resort/restaurant about 30 miles from where I started. I decided to try to get there before they closed (which I wrongly believed it was at 9pm). If I could get a meal and maybe some snacks, I would be more comfortable with the amount of food that I have until the next resupply.</p>
<p>I hiked fast in the morning through a forest of dead trees, result of a wildfire a few years ago. Not the best landscape. I did almost 15 miles at 11am.</p>
<p>Once again, it was hot. Sometimes it amazes me how much I sweat and how much water I can drink. Today should be the last day of this heatwave (it’s already much cooler than previous nights now).</p>
<p>I was looking for a good place to have lunch and suddenly there was this perfect spot by the riverside, with shade and a nice way to enter the river. I went for a swim and spent more than one an a half hour there! It felt great to scrub off the salt 🧂 that’s been accumulating on my skin for the past 4 days!</p>
<p>For the next four hours (10 miles) the path had  4000ft of elevation gain with almost no shade. After liters of sweat, I finally make it to the top, where I had a big shade break at the water source there. I had to filter 6 liters of water, since I drank 4 liters in one go.</p>
<p>This was the moment that I realized that the resort/restaurant’s closing time was 7pm (and not 9). It would be almost impossible to make it in time. I decided not to take the side trail there and keep hiking further. I’ll figure out the food situation in another opportunity.</p>
<p>Along the way there were boxes with books for hikers! I miss reading so much, but I definitely don’t have the time and energy at the moment. Good night 🥱!</p>
<p>(I bought a bag of savory nuts to mix with my granola. I wanted to buy the plain salted nuts but unfortunately I bought by mistake a flavor with herbs (rosemary, oregano and more) and olives. I accidentally created “olivranola” and it’s absolutely disgusting 🤮!)</p>

<p>Since I didn’t use the rain fly on the tent I could feel the wind in the early morning. It was the first time on the PCT that this early breeze was warm.</p>
<p>During the day my thermometer went up to 41°C and I could feel it. Today I drank 12 liters of water and could drink more right now, but I have to save water because tomorrow the day starts with a 16 miles stretch without water and I have only 3 liter with me.</p>
<p>I took 2 longer-than-average one hour breaks, at 10am and at 15am, close to the water and under the shade. I cameled up 2 liters of water on each break.</p>
<p>I’m getting more and more confident that, mile-wise, I will be able to be in Old Station’s post office by Monday morning. The problem is that I’ve been eating a lot and I might need to either start rationing my food on the coming days or stop in a town to do a mini-resupply before grabbing my package 📦 in Old Station.</p>

<p>This was my warmest night on the PCT. I’m happy that I swapped my -15°C sleeping bag (1kg) for a 0°C quilt (600g) last week!</p>
<p>As it happens every time that I sleep without the rain fly, I could see the stars during the night and it’s so cool! The sky was very clear and I could see <em>a lot</em> of stars!</p>
<p>Gladly when I woke up the fire from yesterday was gone. I met a hiker (Hatchet, I think) early in the morning who told me the fire was 10 miles south from Donner Pass (where I re-started the PCT yesterday). Good that I was already past it 😮‍💨.</p>
<p>Inspired by a beautiful sunrise, I did 12 miles before 10am. I kept pushing until 2:30pm, when I had covered already 22 miles! My thermometer 🌡️ peaked at 39° so I took a good break in the shade after hiking the other seven miles. Even though the mosquitoes were present in the morning they gave me a break in the afternoon!</p>
<p>In one of my breaks, while I was filtering water, an older hiker approached and started to chat. His name was Snakebite, he was 75 and he was from Japan! I had such a good chat with him (some in English some in Japanese), talking about the Shikoku Pilgrimage that I did with Maike last year). I made him cry when I said that I want to be genki like him when I’m 75. Since he hikes in a slower pace, I don’t think I’m going to see Snakebite again. Ganbatte Snakebite-san! Ki o tsukette!</p>
<p>While I write this post (already in my tent, ready to sleep) the sun is setting beautifully. I hope I wake up tomorrow before the sunrise to watch it 🌄👀!</p>
<p>PS: A rattlesnake (!) rattled at me today. I was not expecting to see rattlesnakes anymore! I’m glad that nothing happened… it would be pretty ironic to be bitten by a snake on the day I met Snakebite!</p>

<p>Mile 1154.5 to mile 1174.7</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 20.2 (32.3km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 1174.7 (1879.5km)</p>
<p>We woke up and enjoyed our last breakfast together for at least two months 🥺💜. We started driving a bit before 8am and at 10:30 I was saying goodbye to Maike and taking my first steps on the PCT since more than a week. It felt a bit bittersweet… I had an amazing time with Maike, both on trail and on my time off and to be very very honest I feel a bit demotivated with the PCT (and I blame the mosquitoes). But I have a plan to cheer me up.</p>
<p>I want to finish the PCT as soon as I can. Starting tomorrow, I’ll try to push a marathon per day. More than that, I will do longer stretches on trail before resupplying and I plan to take less zeroes. For this first stretch coming back to the PCT, I want to do 220 miles in 8.5 days. I started today (20 miles down!) and I want (need) to arrive by Monday before the post office closes (4pm) to grab my resupply box 📦. Then, I want to go back to trail on the same day and start a new 9 days stretch. Let’s see how this goes!</p>
<p>The first three or four hours hiking were very busy. It’s Sunday and there were a lot of day hikers and climbers (!) on or around the trail. But slowly it started to become less common to see people and after 3pm I didn’t see anybody for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>Although it was warm, I enjoyed the hiking day. Unfortunately the mosquitoes did show up but they gave a break around dinner time, so it wasn’t so bad.</p>
<p>I must say that I’m becoming a bit scared of the wildfires. Yesterday on our drive to South Lake Tahoe we saw from the car a fire on the mountains and just now, after setting up my tent and starting cooking dinner, I saw that there’s a fire south from where I’m camping. By the amount of smoke it seemed that it had just started but now (8:30pm) it’s worse. The wind is blowing to the other side so I really believe there’s no risk for me. In any case I didn’t put the rain fly on so I can be a bit vigilant during the night.</p>

<p>“It could be worse!” — that was today’s motto.</p>
<p>I can count on one hand the days that I put an alarm to wake up during the PCT. Today, unfortunately, was one of them. Our plan was to pick up a car that we rented from someone using an app at 7am, so we woke up at 5:30 to finish packing. From there we would drive to Truckee and arrive before 2pm to post my resupply package before I restarted from the trailhead me and Maike ended at two weeks ago. From there Maike would return her rented bear canister in South Lake Tahoe and return to San Jose in the afternoon.</p>
<p>This was the actual course of events:</p>
<p>We woke up, finished packing and said goodbye to our hosts. We took an Uber to pick-up the car (carrying all our stuff) and were there at 7am sharp. We waited for one hour and nobody showed up, so we canceled the car. Jessica picked us up and we went to a rental car company (in the meanwhile I reserved one car online to speed up the process). The guy behind the counter said that he was cancelling all the reservations for today because they had no cars available 🤷🏻‍♂️ . It was already 11am and we were still in San Jose (and it was getting warmer).</p>
<p>We tried the app one more time. The only car available was a Fiat 500 with a pick-up time at 4pm. We booked and called the owner to ask if we could do an early pick up. He said we could pick the car up in one hour, so we went to the Post Office in San Jose to send my resupply box (that I will hopefully receive in 9 days) and from there to pick-up the 500. Everything went smoothly and we finally had a car! Time to drive east and think about the plan B, since it was too late to restart the PCT today still.</p>
<p>New plan: we drive to South Lake Tahoe, deliver the bear canister somehow (the place where we rented closed at 4, we would arrive around 7), sleep somewhere in SLT (because Truckee is too expensive and it would be too much to drive today) and tomorrow early morning we drive ~1h30min to the trailhead.</p>
<p>On our way to SLT we saw smoke from a fire in a forest close by. I counted at least 5 airplanes/helicopters carrying buckets of water to control the fire. I’m not necessarily excited to be hiking into the wildfire season now. Today was the fourth day in a row with temperatures over 35°C. Our 500 was also struggling to keep the air inside cool while going up more than 7000ft in elevation gain.</p>
<p>Since we couldn’t actually return the bear canister, we hid it close to the ranger station (where we rented it) and tomorrow we’ll give them a call to check if they found it. From there we had a quick drive to our hotel (that we booked on our way here) and tomorrow we’re trying to leave to the trailhead at 7 and restart the bike at 9 or 10 latest. And then, 8-9 days of hiking with one focus: crush miles! (and escape the wildfires)</p>

<p>Another heat wave day, another day spent mostly inside.</p>
<p>Today I finally started resupplying and re-equipping to restart the PCT. Tomorrow I get back on trail for a new chapter on my thru-hike!</p>
<p>Since I’m done with the Sierra section (arguably the most difficult part of the whole trail) my plan for the next weeks is to increase my daily mileage and also the number of days that I spend on trail without resupplying. For the first time, I’m sending a resupply package ahead, since I’ll try to stop in towns and take as few zeroes as I can from now on. My next two hiking stretches should take 8-9 days each and I’m relying solely on my package 📦 for the next resupply (which will be in the middle of nowhere).</p>
<p>In the evening we went to downtown San Jose to enjoy some live music and to say goodbye to the best hosts I could have wished for: Chris and Jessica, thank you so much for all the support and everything you two have done for me in the past days (weeks). It was absolutely awesome to see you both and spend some good time together. I’m really grateful to have had the chance to use your place as part of my adventure! Thank you so much 💜🫶!</p>

<p>We wanted to do something very American on Independence Day but the 40°C day made us decide to stay home and enjoy some air conditioning. In fact, Chris and Jessica invited a few Brazilians (including children and dogs 🥰) for lunch and we made lasagnas for everybody!</p>
<p>For my surprise, some of the guests were former colleagues of mine back in Brazil and it was really cool to see and chat with them after so many years.</p>
<p>I don’t remember the last time I ate so much. During the day I had probably 5 liters of beer, lasagna, brownies, tiramisu, Melona ice cream and all the snacks that I could find. This week I’ve been doing a very good job at fattening up (I lost 8 kilos since I started the PCT and I really needed to gain some of the weight back).</p>
<p>(Un)fortunately I completely forgot to take pictures. I see that as a good sign 😊. I had a lot of fun today!</p>
<p>(It was so hot today that the thermostat couldn’t keep up and it was complaining that it had been trying to cool down the house for a few hours and the temperature was only going up 🥵)</p>

<p>I really can get used to waking up at 8 and not at 5 😬! After having a coffee and sandwiches at Beanstalk Cafe we walked to Yerba Buena Center for the Arts to visit a (free!) exhibition from Nick Dong. It had some crazy immersive artworks made either lights and mirrors. I really enjoyed it!</p>
<p>From there we walked to Embarcadero and stopped for lunch on the way. In between walking and occasional coffees, we had a very chill afternoon.</p>
<p>We took the train back to San Jose where Jessica and Chris picked us up and the four of us went out for dinner. After eating we realized that today we had breakfast, lunch AND dinner, something that hadn’t happened in a while! (and we also noticed that I ate my food and half of Maike’s food in every single meal today 😅😋)</p>

<p>Waking up just to fall back asleep again is something that I haven’t done a lot these past two months and I certainly want to change that this week! So, this is exactly how the morning started!</p>
<p>After having a slow breakfast, we packed our tiny and light bags (no food carry, no sleeping bags, no bear canister!) and went to the station to get our train to San Francisco. One and a half hour later, we arrived (it’s crazy how cars and trains are faster than walking…).</p>
<p>We were able to check in early at our hostel, which is always good. From there we walked (uphill!) to Fisherman’s Wharf and the Marina, where we rented bikes to cross the Golden Gate Bridge 🌉 and go to Sausalito. The day was sunny, bright, clear and warm and the bike ride was very pleasant. In Sausalito we had burgers 🍔 and salad 🥗 for lunch, ice creams 🍦 and coffees ☕️ for dessert and enjoyed some chill time until late afternoon, when we got the ferry ⛴️ back to San Francisco. After returning the bikes we walked back to our hostel. We were able to enjoy a beautiful sunset on the way 🌇!</p>

<p>After having a not so fulfilling breakfast at the hostel (toast and jam) we took the trolley 🚃 to Castro where we would have a free walking tour and learn more about the history of this wonderful neighborhood.</p>
<p>Robert, our guide, having lived for decades in Castro himself, was very knowledgeable and insightful and we learned so much about how Castro came to be this epicenter of the</p>
<p>LGTQ community. Totally recommend the walking tour with him!</p>
<p>We were starving by the time we stopped for lunch at Cafe Mystique (our guide’s suggestion) with another german tour attendee around 2pm. From there we had a coffee and brigadeiros at Café de Casa.</p>
<p>We slowly walked all the way back to the hostel where we just chilled for the rest of the afternoon. I watched Brazil vs. Colombia for Copa America and later we watched Mrs. Doubtfire at the hostel’s movie night!</p>

<p>PCT Miles: 0</p>
<p>Total Miles: 1154.5 (1847.2km)</p>
<p>Even before I started the PCT, there was one thing that I always wanted to do whenever I had a break from hiking: be a trail angel! Today sounded like the perfect day to do so! Of course Maike, Chris and Jessica were onboard!</p>
<p>Here was our plan: yesterday we bought some cookies 🍪 , gatorades and fresh fruits (🍎, 🍌, 🍒, 🍇) to bring today to the same trailhead where me and Maike finished our section together last Friday. The idea was to stay there and offer a refreshment to any PCT hiker that showed up on the parking lot.</p>
<p>So, after we checked out we drove to the trailhead’s parking lot, put all the food on a wood bench that we found and waited there for hikers. We stayed for a few minutes and nobody showed up. We had agreed that we would spend maybe 1-2 hours there and I was hoping to see at least 4-5 hikers in this timeframe.</p>
<p>I was feeling a little bit frustrated to see nobody so I decided to walk a bit to the actual trail and see if I could find someone coming. And then I saw something that I was not expecting at all!</p>
<p>A few meters down the road, I saw a couple setting up this gazebo, like if they were setting up a small gathering area. As soon as they saw me, the woman excitedly asked me: are you a PCT hiker?</p>
<p>It turned out that this couple were hikers from the Class of 2021 and they lived close to the trail nowadays and they do some trail magic every now and then. They were setting up this space this morning with shade, chairs, drinks and making hot dogs for the thru-hikers! I explained my situation (that I’m indeed a PCT thru-hiker but I was taking a week off and that I was there with my friends to do some trail magic ourselves as well). Can we all join you guys? I asked. OF COURSE they replied in unison and a few moments later we brought our things and combined our trail magic together!</p>
<p>We stayed for probably two hours and had an absolutely great time. We met Pain Perdu and her boyfriend, Space Case, Sharkbait, Rosie, Koda (a czech girl that I met at Scout and Frodo, before I started the PCT!), Helène, Cashew (one of the dogs) and more people that I don’t remember the names. It felt so good to be able to give a little back to my fellow hikers. We left the place with our spirits elevated and empty coolers! We super happy that everything went better than we planned!</p>
<p>Before driving back to San Jose we chilled a bit at the Doner River’s riverside. I was feeling over the moon with this amazing experience that we had today!</p>
<p>Tomorrow me and Maike will be going to San Francisco to be tourists for a few days. The plan is for her to drive me back next saturday to the same trailhead of today so I can continue my hike keeping a continuous foot path). But until then, I’m using the fact that I’m a bit ahead of schedule to take some well deserved vacations from the PCT 😎!</p>

<p>Mile 1147.7 to mile 1154.5</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 6.8 (10.9km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 1154.5 (1847.2km)</p>
<p>Knowing that you have a short day into town ahead is a double-edged sword: it’s supposedly a short day and you’re motivated to arrive. At the same time, you know you can chill because there’s usually no pressure. We took our time to hike the 7 miles today and enjoy the much less windy day.</p>
<p>In one of our shorts stops, I was taking some pictures on top of a rock when I saw another hiker approaching. After a few seconds I recognized her: it was Clara (literally the only person on the PCT that I knew before starting the hike! We started together in Campo and saw each other for the last time in Idyllwild on day 10)!!!</p>
<p>It was so good to see her! She’s still going strong and said she’s now crushing more and more miles everyday and has a target date to finish the PCT: September 6th! She was hiking with Haribo and after a quick heads up she kept hiking on. We wanted to meet her in Truckee later for a coffee  but unfortunately orur hitchhiking schedule didn’t help and we weren’t able to see her again. Somehow I’m sure I’ll see her on trail again! Happy trails, Clara!</p>
<p>The trail this morning was fine, with some snow patches here and there, but nothing sketchy. We crossed paths with quite a few day hikers and chatted with most of them, as our mood was elevated. The highlight of the short day was to hike through a ski station! It’s so interesting to see ski lifts, gondolas and the pistes themselves all without snow. We actually went down (waking) one stretch of a blue piste!</p>
<p>We were a bit hungry when we arrived at the parking lot where we should try to hitch, so we sat down and started to eat some of our snacks and observe the movement. Hitching on a trailhead parking lot should be relatively easy: there’s not a lot of “traffic” but people are usually friendly and willing to give a hike to the next town after they had a pleasant hike themselves and are usually in good mood.</p>
<p>While still munching our food, we saw two guys coming back from the trail to their cars. They had no backpacks and seemed pretty chill. For a split second I thought about letting the laziness take control and ignore them, but I was looking forward to a breakfast burrito, so I went to them and asked “hey good morning. Are you guys by any chance going to Truckee? Could you give us a ride?” Double yes as an answer and we had a ride on our first try!!</p>
<p>They were Dion and Nick, from Australia and New Zealand, and they’re in the US traveling around and visiting some nice spots. They were staying in Truckee for the night so it wasn’t a problem at all first them to bring us. We talked a bit about hiking and the PCT and in 20 minutes we were in town, ready to devour our food and cold drinks!</p>
<p>After lunch we had another mission: find a way to go to our Airbnb which was in a ski resort, 12 miles away. Google Maps told us they there should be a bus that could bring us somewhere nearby our place. We walked a bit to the bus stop 🚏 and literally one minute later a car stopped for us “hey, do you guys want a ride?”. We couldn’t believe our eyes and ears!</p>
<p>Dave, the driver, was a local who also hikes and has hiked the PCT. He said he understands how helpful these rides are and that he always tries to give rides when he can. We talked a bit about hiking (as always) but also music and Europe. It was a pleasant 20 minutes hike to our Airbnb.</p>
<p>We had to wait a bit outside for our checkin time but afterwards everything went well: the wonders of flush toilet and a warm shower cannot be stated enough! It was our first shower since Sunday! Maike seemed really impressed with the dirtiness of her feet 😆.</p>
<p>For the rest of the day we chilled, of course. We finally had time to catch up with everything online, listen to some music and do nothing. Our friends Chris and Jessica arrived late in the evening (we were sleeping already) and tomorrow we take an adventurous zero!</p>

<p>Today marks the first day of my one week vacation from the PCT! I will be taking seven zeroes in a row to enjoy the company and opportunity to see my friends Chris and Jessica and also, of course, spend some chill time with Maike. And what better way of starting this week off other than grabbing drinks, a cooler, snacks and go rafting with your friends!?</p>
<p>We spent our morning paddling along the Truckee River, enjoying the good weather. Maike and me even took an (intentional) dip into the water 💧. After 3-4 hours of what we called “american rafting” (slowly going down the river with a cooler full of drinks and snacks in the middle of the raft) we arrived at the end of our adventure and took a bus back to the starting point.</p>
<p>After having pizzas for lunch with an awesome view from the Tahoe Lake, we returned to our Airbnb and rested until the evening, when we made burgers on the grill and played games!</p>

<p>After having spotted a bear, we both were very happy to have other hikers camping with us last night. By the time we woke up though (around 6:30) almost everybody was gone. We decided to enjoy the mosquitoless morning and have breakfast before we started hiking. I had classic chocolate electronola and Maike had peanut butter overload: peanut butter granola, crunchy peanut butter and, instead of milk or yoghurt, it’s soaked in powdered peanut butter (plus water).</p>
<p>When we were about to leave camp, one hiker passed by and I recognized him: It was Rocky (the Lithuanian guy that I mentioned on Day 54)! It was so good to see a familiar face! Rocky is such a character: he was over the moon because a trail angel had gifted him hiking shoes (he was hiking on sandals and flip flops before) and he updated us about my ex hiker companions: Bullfrog was still taking zeroes in South Lake Tahoe, Geezer was 3-4 days ahead and Tangent was off trail attending two weddings but would come back. Rocky’s good mood was contagious and we left camp with our spirits elevated!</p>
<p>It was a chilly and very windy morning. We started hiking over a ridge and over some ski areas. It’s very interesting to see how the mountains where people ski during winter look like without all the snow. Talking about snow, we had some today but we managed everything just fine.</p>
<p>During our second break of the day another hiker passed by and once more I recognized him: it was Fizz! (I met him on day 42 and hiked with him for a few days in the Sierra). We chatted a bit about the past days. As always he was in good mood, saying that he was having a great time and that this is what the PCT is about: to enjoy and have fun. He always states that he will leave the PCT as soon as he stops enjoying and have fun everyday and he’s still here 😊. For me it was super cool to see Fizz (and Rocky) again and introduce them to Maike!</p>
<p>We decided to do a longer day today and hike almost 17 miles, so we can hike less tomorrow and arrive in Truckee earlier. Everything went fine until the last two miles. The wind started blowing really hard on the last steep ascend of the day (1.5 miles) and literally on the last 0.5 miles until campground, which was a ridge (a narrow path where you have a cliff on both sides). It was a bit nerve wracking to keep the balance against the strong wind (specially for Maike who called it “the ridge of horror“) but we made camp safe and sound. We pitched our tent, made dinner and enjoyed a beautiful sunset. There were no mosquitoes during the whole day, but the wind outside is still strong so we were happy to be warm on our tents as soon as we could.</p>
<p>If everything goes well tomorrow we arrive in Truckee for lunch and we will meet our good friends Chris and Jessica who are coming from San Jose to spend the weekend with us 🫶!</p>

<p>The day started exactly the way we didn’t want: full of mosquitoes. For the first four hours of the day we hiked wearing our rain clothes plus the head net. Thankfully it was a bit cloudy so it was not that bad, warmth wise (definitely not that good either). Not being able to have proper breaks and the lack of prospect for any improvements on the mosquitoes situation really put both my and Maike’s mood down.</p>
<p>Mileage-wise, we had our best morning so far: by 10am we had covered half of what we had planned for today (7 out of 14 miles). We were still annoyed by the mosquitoes though.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, around 11am, we noticed that the amount of mosquitoes started to drop. At some point, Maike gave a leap of faith and removed all her mosquito protection. I did the same and for our positive surprise, the mosquitoes were almost gone indeed. The hike in the afternoon was much more pleasant, with high morale and low mosquitoes. And since we were ahead of schedule, we took longer mosquitoless breaks.</p>
<p>About 2 miles off to finish our day we had a quick break to drink water. Something caught my attention down in the valley and I saw something moving. Sure that it was a deer, I kept looking until I could see without a shade of doubt: I was looking at a black bear. “Oh my god it’s a bear” I said to Maike. She turned around and confirmed. Both me and Maike were seeing a bear in nature for the first time. “What do we do?”. “Let’s make noise and keep going”.</p>
<p>As soon as we started to clang our hiking poles together and Maike started singing, the bear (which we named Hera) ran away to the opposite direction. We kept hiking and singing steadily for the next 2 miles until we reached our campground for tonight. We were hoping to meet more people but the campground (that has space for about 5-6 tents) was empty. We started to pitch our tents and do our chores.</p>
<p>No more than half an hour later, we were both relieved to see that two other hikers arrived to camp here. When Maike was taking to one of them, he asked “is that Bruno?”. It was Pete, one of the hikers that arrived was part of the first group of people that I hiked together with on my very first day! That’s so cool!</p>
<p>Later more and more people started to show up and we ended up having a nice and cozy tiny neighborhood for tonight.</p>

<p>After a long night of good sleep we woke up to even more mosquitoes than the evening before. I am so glad that I don’t need to expose my butt to pee like other people here 🤭.</p>
<p>Head net, wind jacket and rain pants on, we started hiking immediately. No breakfast, no brushing our teeth 🤢.</p>
<p>The morning was a bit cloudy and we started the day going up a pass (Dick’s Pass). I was a little bit concerned about the pass because I read some reports that there would be a lot of snow there, specially during the descent. We were happy to be able to hike our own alternative route and with some zigzagging and bushwhacking we avoided most of the left over snow patches. Before that, at the pass, I introduced Maike to electronola and it was approved by her 👍!</p>
<p>Today we also had a more challenging stream crossing. We almost decided to cross via the stream itself but at the end we did some log and rock 🪵🪨  hopping and ended our second day with dry feet 🦶!</p>
<p>The downside of today were the mosquitoes. It was a plague. Miserable little creatures sent by the devil. We developed a few strategies to escape from them. The best being to keep moving all the time, even when we were taking breaks. Eating, drinking water or simply resting becomes a torture. You cannot ever stop moving. We had the company of these tiny bastards during our entire day. At the end of the day we were completely exhausted since we couldn’t take proper breaks. At least after we made camp, we were spared for dinner and had a little bit of peace to eat, finally ✌️.</p>

<p>Echo Lake to mile 1104.5</p>

<p>Total Miles: 1104.5 (1767.2km)</p>
<p>Our hiker rhythm + jet leg combo worked once more and at 6 we were awake. We had time in the morning to finalize packing our bags, have a nice breakfast and wait for Diva 🧑‍🎤, our trail angel, to pick us up at 8 sharp. During the half hour drive to Echo Lake, we had a nice conversation with Diva, who is a triple-crowner and very talkative. At 9am we (re-)started our hike!</p>
<p>For the first two hours or so we hiked on the rim of Echo Lake and the view was astonishing. We probably hiked by 4-5 lakes today and they were all very beautiful! We saw many hikers today (around 20), not only PCT hikers but also day/multi-day hikers. This area where we are is called Desolation Wilderness and it’s absolutely gorgeous.</p>
<p>During the day we had a bit of everything, which I think was a cool introduction to the PCT for Maike. We had a bit of an ascend, a bit of snow, a bit of wind, a bit of sunshine a bit of stream crossings, a bit of mud. And a lot of bites from mosquitoes 🥲.</p>
<p>As we continue our tradition of making wise decisions, we took our time to enjoy the day today and finished the day at 11 miles, which is exactly what we had planned: our goal 🥅 is to arrive in Truckee by the end of Friday and therefore we need to do an average of 12 miles per day ✅!</p>
<p>Tonight we’re camping close to another beautiful lake (Lake Gilmore) and Maike already got into the hiker’s sleeping schedule: it’s 8pm and she’s been sleeping for half an hour already 😴.</p>

<p>Thanks to my jetlag and Bruno‘s hiker rhythm we had an early start today!</p>
<p>We drove 4 hours back to South Lake Tahoe. There, we organised a bear canister for me, had a picnic under pine trees and played snack tetris with our bear canisters.</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning we will continue (or in my case <em>start</em>) the PCT adventure! A kind trail angel 👼 will pick us up and bring us to Echo Lake where Bruno left the trail last Wednesday.</p>
<p>I’m excited and at the same time intimidated by the PCT. It will be the first time that I am so far out in nature and away from civilisation 🏕️ Cheers to all the „first times“ to come and let’s goo!! 🤝</p>

<p>Today we went to the equipment store to buy the remaining equipment for Maike’s PCT and then we went to the supermarket to resupply.</p>
<p>Afternoon and evening were spent eating, packing and chilling 😊! We were already ready to sleep at hikers midnight (9pm)!</p>

<p>I spent the morning eating, drinking freshly brewed coffee and researching the next steps on the PCT.</p>
<p>In the afternoon I drove to SFO to pick Maike up! She came to spend a few weeks in the US and starting on Monday we’re going to hike at least one week together!</p>

<p>Today I did very little. I ate a breakfast burrito, burger and fries. I quickly went to the equipment store to buy a new pair of shorts and a sun hoodie. I slowly aired my tent, sleeping bag and mat. I chilled in the hammock. I listened to music. And that was about it!</p>

<p>I went to the parking lot of Echo Lake and saw two men chatting close to their cars. I asked if any of them was going to South Lake Tahoe. Nope.</p>
<p>They suggested me what I was already considering: going <em>back</em> 1.4 miles to the highway and hitch there. On the road, almost all cars are going to South Lake Tahoe so in theory it would be easier to hitch there. At the parking lot, people could be going anywhere. Another possibility would be to be persistent at the parking lot. Eventually I would get a ride, one of the men said.</p>
<p>Where are you from? The older man asked. He was unloading some construction material from a very old and beaten truck. I am from Brazil, I replied. “Oh, você fala Português? Vamos conversar!” he said back!</p>
<p>The man, Christopher, invited me to his cabin and I also met his son, Julian, mid-20s who had just finished his studies in Barcelona. They were there for a few days to repair some things in the cabin and enjoy some mountain biking.</p>
<p>We talked for almost two hours. Christopher explained me that he started studying Brazilian Portuguese because he likes the language and he was clearly trying his best to speak correct Portuguese and not Spanish (he’s studying Spanish at the moment) and it was super cool to see an American putting so much effort into learning foreign languages. Not something you see everyday.</p>
<p>Christopher then said that he would gladly give me a ride to town! He just needed to finish unloading the truck and soon after we were on our way to South Lake Tahoe. Since it was still before 5pm, I decided to go to the car rental company and see if I could get a car today already (I have a reservation for tomorrow). If that worked out, instead of sleeping one night in South Lake Tahoe I would drive  ~5 hours to San Jose and sleep at my friend’s place. (I’m having a quad-zero, more on that in a future post!)</p>
<p>Long story short, I couldn’t rent a car because my driver’s license is dutch and I don’t have an “international driver’s license” 🪪. The guy said he would even cancel my reservation since I wouldn’t be able to rent the car tomorrow as well.</p>
<p>That would completely ruin my plan. I googled other car rental companies and nothing. But then there was an ad for this app, Turo, in which you can rent other people’s cars. I downloaded it, found one single car available in the whole region, called the owner to make sure everything was set and it turned out that I could have the car within one hour! I just needed to find a way to get to the car, 4 miles away. No way I would walk four more miles today!</p>
<p>I saw some Lime/Byrd scooters 🛴 on the sidewalk. I stopped by one, opened the Byrd app, read the QR-code and the scooter unlocked! HIkertrash with a PCT backpack riding a scooter in South Lake Tahoe!</p>
<p>Everything went well with the car and by 6:30pm I was already driving to San Jose. All of a sudden I was in a completely parallel universe: this morning I was hiking in the Sierra. Now I’m in a highway 🛣️ driving a car towards civilization, watching mesmerized the city lights in the distance.</p>
<p>After five hours driving I arrived safely. I’ll stay here until Sunday and then drive back to South Lake Tahoe and restart the trail on Monday with a very special +1!</p>

<p>PCT Miles: 19.0 (30.4km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 1093.4 (1749.4km)</p>
<p>Today’s plan was straightforward: get to South Lake Tahoe (which is a hitch from Echo Lake, the last waypoint on the Sierra section of the PCT).</p>
<p>Bullfrog went a bit ahead of me. I started hiking before 5:30 and could watch a beautiful sunrise. For the last pass of the Sierra section (Carson Pass), I was a bit afraid to have to deal with too much snow/ice but there was only a bit of snow and it was frozen solid (it’s been cold for the past three days). The descent also came without surprises and before 8am we were having cookies, brownies, fruit and soda. Trail Magic 🪄!</p>
<p>They had watermelons and grapes so I stayed more than I should have. At that point, the only food I had with me was 2 portions of electronola. I was very happy to have a more enjoyable breakfast.</p>
<p>It was a quite uneventful hike after that. I saw some day hikers along the trail, went a bit up and down in elevation, crossed some streams. After I reached 17 miles I had the chance to hitch to South Lake Tahoe but I didn’t want to hitch on the highway so I kept going to Echo Lake. There, I would need to ask for a ride on the parking lot, which I prefer. But before that I had milkshake and chips — I was starving!</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, the Sierra is over! It was quite an experience to hike and camp in such high elevation. Lots of challenges and good memories but I’m glad it’s past now! On Monday <em>we</em> start the third section of the PCT: Northern California!</p>

<p>I slept for 8-9 hours peacefully. I woke up super warm and I was surprised when I saw that it was -6°C! Apparently wearing all my clothes can really keep me warm.</p>
<p>When I left my tent I saw that Bullfrog had re-started the fire. He was boiling water for his every morning tea. He’s English.</p>
<p>Usually I don’t eat breakfast when I wake up. I prefer to have it after a few hours hiking. But a campfire is for sure a good reason to have break this rule, so after I packed up I joined Bullfrog for half an hour or so and had my chocolate electronola. I started hiking around 6:30 and Bullfrog stayed, enjoying the fire.</p>
<p>The day was chilly but less windy. I don’t know if I already told this, but I’m hiking wearing my fleece because my sun hoodie (hiking shirt) was so full of holes that I had to throw it away. In the end it’s been very convenient because the past three days have been quite cold.</p>
<p>I knew from the beginning that today I would do 20 miles (and 19 tomorrow), so I took my time and hiked at a chill pace. Twenty miles shouldn’t be that difficult. And it wasn’t. The day passed by and I had a very pleasant hiking day.</p>
<p>One thing they have been missing (thank god) for a few days already are the mosquitoes. I really really really hope it stays like that.</p>
<p>I arrived at camp before 4pm and had time to chill and do everything slowly, which is always good. Bullfrog just arrived (it’s 6:15pm now). Tomorrow I should have no problems getting to Echo Lake (19 miles) and from there hitching to South Lake Tahoe! Can’t wait to have a pizza in town 🍕😋!</p>

<p>It was a cold night and a cold morning. It took me a while to gather the strength to leave the warmth of the sleeping bag and start packing. I left camp at 7am.</p>
<p>Around 10am I met Bullfrog on trail. He had an early start so he was ahead of me. He was having breakfast so I moved on.</p>
<p>Even though it was sunny, there was a chilly wind blowing during the whole day. The trail was quite pleasant, with not many snow patches or sketchy parts. I took my time to hike and camped early, at 5pm. Around 6pm Bullfrog showed up and set his tent here as well! As I write this post, he’s building a fire! Temperature will drop below freezing tonight. I’m going to sleep wearing all my clothes!</p>

<p>This is the last week that I’m hiking in the Sierra Nevada! The big passes are behind me and hopefully the big snow too!</p>
<p>It’s always amazing to wake up and have warm breakfast and coffee. For the second day in a row, I had pancakes 🥞, hash brown, eggs 🍳 and unlimited coffee. When I finished my plate, somebody from the store gave ice cream to all hikers. I was so full and very glad that I still had more than two hours before the shuttle would leave to the trailhead so I could digest all the food.</p>
<p>After getting rid of a lot of stuff (snow gear, extra clothes, etc), my backpack is much lighter and compact. Usually when I leave town I carry food for 6-8 days. This time I have food for four, which makes the load even lighter. I started hiking at 10:30 and kept hiking in almost one go for 7 hours. I only stopped to filter water. Rambo went ahead and I hiked with Bullfrog for a while. We ended up all finding spots to camp a little bit far from each other, so I’m camping alone tonight (and without mosquitoes!!!).</p>
<p>During the past two days I saw probably another 20 PCT hikers. I don’t know where these people were before, but it was nice to see new faces. The shuttle to the trailhead was full (10 people) and I quickly chatted with some of the hikers during the day.</p>
<p>The hike itself was super chill today. A few snow patches here and there and no wet feet! Fingers crossed 🤞 that the conditions will continue like that for the coming days, so I can officially finish the Sierra section and take a few zeroes to celebrate!</p>

<p>I’m not sure exactly how to describe Kennedy Meadows North. It’s kind of a resort where people come to spend the day or a few days camping or they can rent a chalet. They also offer dorm rooms for hikers. Besides all the facilities (internet, laundry, showers, etc) there’s also a very convenient store, a restaurant and a saloon (a bar?). They offer free shuttles to and from the trailhead. It’s also kind of a farm. There are horses and cows. Everything is run by generators. At 11pm they shut everything down and turn back on at 5:30am.</p>
<p>It’s perfect place for a zero. I was able to hang everything that was wet from two nights ago, send home my snow gear (ice axe and crampons) plus some items that I don’t need anymore. Hopefully my backpack will be considerably lighter for the coming stretch. I’m still carrying the bear canister for a few more days though.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I’ll start the last section of the Sierra! Hopefully I’ll be able to do the remaining 75 miles in 4 days (that’s what I have food for) and arrive in Echo Lake/South Lake Tahoe by Wednesday or Thursday morning. From there, I plan to do a quick side trip 🙃!</p>

<p>Mile 1005.6 to Kennedy Meadows North</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 12.5 (20km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 1018.1 (1629.0km)</p>
<p>Today I had one of the worst mornings since I started the PCT. It wasn’t necessarily bad, but not too good either.</p>
<p>Almost everything was wet. Me and my sleeping system were dry, that was it. It was chilly and windy and it was a bit tough to pack everything, specially the tent. My gloves, which I store on one of the hip belt pockets, were also wet. My socks were wet. On top of all the wetness, my hiking shirt (also wet) is falling apart. For the first time I hiked with something else instead of it: my fleece. I don’t think I can use my hiking shirt anymore.</p>
<p>I knew the day was going to be short, but with a big ascend to almost 11000 feet. The ascend was fine, almost snow free. The trail was a bit slippery and there was a thin layer of ice on top of the snow and rocks. And there were a lot of rocks: these mountains are covered by volcanic rocks, which aren’t the best thing to hike on.</p>
<p>Descending, as usual, was tougher than going up. The fact that I forgot to check for water sources and had to hike 8 miles without drinking only made it worse (I’m so used to have water whenever you want here in the Sierra).</p>
<p>But I had enough time and knew that I was going in the direction of taking a zero tomorrow. So I took my time and tried to enjoy the descent and glissaded twice (one intentionally and the other by accident)! There was also a sketchy part where I had to kick in footholds on the softening snow to be able to traverse a small cliff. Joys of hiking on snow.</p>
<p>From the descent I could see the highway 🛣️. That helped me to give the final push and before 2pm I was at the road. I knew there would be a shuttle that brings PCT hikers to Kennedy Meadows North (a resupply, dining and lodging place, 8 miles from the trailhead). While I waited I saw Rambo coming down the mountain. We chatted a bit and he told me that he knew it was me that made the footholds and thanked me for them! A few minutes later came Bullfrog just in time for the shuttle. At 3:30pm we were all in KMN!</p>
<p>Here we got a room for the three of us and we’re all taking zeroes tomorrow. There are some other hikers around here that I’ve seen before, but haven’t spoke to them yet. This place is huge and quite interesting. I’ll tell more about it tomorrow, on my zero day post!</p>

<p>Mile 981.0 to mile 1005.6</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 24.6 (39.4km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 1005.6 (1609.0km)</p>
<p>Every morning I have to pack my backpack from scratch: since the sleeping bag and sleeping mattress go on the bottom of the backpack, I need to empty it and reassemble all the contents.</p>
<p>Since day one I use a big dry sack where I put the sleeping stuff, my clothes (extra socks, sleeping merino pants, fleece, puffy jacket) and my power bank. Every morning I make sure that everything fits in the dry sack properly and that the dry sack is properly closed. After 58 days hiking, today was the first day that I was very thankful for my own discipline. I’ll get there soon (spoiler alert: it rained).</p>
<p>It was not so cold, so I slept with one of the doors of the tent open (but with the net, of course). It’s so cool to wake up at night, open your eyes and see the most starry sky 🌌! That’s for sure one of my favorite things about camping!</p>
<p>I had an ambitious plan for today: make it through the loooong ascend to Dorothy Lake Pass (and leave Yosemite) and go down to get as close as possible to Sonora Pass, where I can go to town, hopefully tomorrow. This would be awesome because I would arrive in town one day earlier than I planned and could take a nice (and well deserved!) zero. But that also meant a 24 miles day.</p>
<p>The day started well. The deer family was still around in the morning and I was in good mood so I started the day hiking a bit faster, trying to push a bit on the ascend to Dorothy Lake Pass. It was very wet and swampy and my feet stayed wet for the whole day. It’s actually kind of liberating when you realize that there’s no other way, so you should just accept that you can freely step in water or mud.</p>
<p>Mosquitoes surrounded me at all times. In the morning I had to hike with rain pants, wind jacket and the head net. It was suffocating to hike on my own portable sauna, but it’s just maddening otherwise. For three times I tried to take a break but it’s just impossible to enjoy, so I kept hiking without a break for 14 miles. I could only stop to have breakfast+lunch at 1pm, having started at 6. I was starving.</p>
<p>Good thing is that it made a very productive morning, although I still needed to hike up three more miles to go over the pass and descend for seven miles to the campsite.</p>
<p>At 3pm I made it to the top. There was very little snow (but a lot of water). By the way, I don’t think I’ll need my snow gear anymore. I’ll probably mail them back next week.</p>
<p>Crossing the pass, I was in a tight but possible schedule. I was hoping for little snow on the other side as well. What I was not really expecting was rain. And hail.</p>
<p>I still had to hike for 7 miles, which usually takes me 3-4 hours, depending on the trail. As soon as it started raining I wore my rain jacket (for the first time!) and exhaled relieved as I remembered that my things were protected from the rain in my backpack. A few minutes after the rain, it started to hail. The mix of rain and hail lasted for about one hour. For the first mile or so (~30 min), there was a bit of snow, but then the trail became snow-free. I was a bit scared when it started raining but I checked the forecast and the sky should clear up tonight still. I just wanted to arrive at camp,</p>
<p>so I hiked fast. In the end, the rain didn’t bother me that much.</p>
<p>I arrived at camp before 6pm (!), so I had plenty of time. Unfortunately the rain became a bit heavier while I was setting up my tent and everything got wet inside. Right after it stopped raining I opened the doors and let the air circulate to dry the tent a bit and since all my sleeping stuff are super dry, it’s all good!</p>
<p>Currently it’s not possible to enjoy the camp. It’s unbelievable the amount of mosquitoes and how they’re really hungry! Since yesterday, the first thing to do when arriving at camp is to wear the anti-mosquito clothes (pants, jacket, net). Only then you can proceed with the other chores.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I have a relatively short day (12.5 miles) to arrive in town! The two problems are: first, it’s a big ascend (~2300ft/700m) up to almost 11000ft/3350m. Hopefully there won’t be a lot of snow to slow me down. Second, all my things are wet. I’m not sure how early I’ll be able to leave camp in the morning. Let’s see!</p>

<p>Mile 964.0 to mile 981.0</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 17.0 (27.2km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 981.0 (1569.6km)</p>
<p>Because of the distance between Benson Pass and Seavey Pass (less than 10 miles), I wanted to do both passes today. Otherwise it would be a very short day.</p>
<p>There’s much, much less snow here at Yosemite than before Donohue Pass (where I entered Yosemite National Park). Less snow means that the passes are less challenging (no snow gear, following the trail instead of random footpaths) but as tiring as before.</p>
<p>I was happy to be at the top of Benson Pass before 9am. It was a steep ascend with a lot of switchbacks and not too much snow. I had breakfast (chocolate electronola) at the top of the pass.</p>
<p>Then it came the descent. It took me almost forever (3-4 hours) to go down. It was as steep as the ascent, but with much more snow, ice and wet (slippery) ground. It was a patience game to slowly go down the mountain. My knees were not very happy at the end of the descent.</p>
<p>I was a bit demotivated. It took be too long to completely do the first pass and at lunch I spend some time thinking about a plan B. Maybe I could at least go to the top of the second pass and camp there? That sounded like an ok idea.</p>
<p>After my lunch break, around 2pm, I started ascending Seavey Pass. Steep, but almost snow-free. Soon after I started ascending I hear someone behind me yelling “Bruno!”. I turn back it’s Bullfrog (!!) with another hiker, Rambo. “Hey Bullfrog, it’s good to see you!” I say. “It’s good to see you too but  god I hate these bloody mosquitoes!” he replies. Yeah, me too.</p>
<p>It’s about 3:30 when we reach the top of the pass. It’s was not difficult, but very exhausting. Bullfrog and Rambo decided to camp on the top of the pass to avoid mosquitoes (higher altitude = less mosquitoes). Since it was a bit early, I decided to go down the mountain and see how much I could still hike today.</p>
<p>After going down the pass and hiking a total of 17km, there was a waist-height crossing with quite a strong current. After taking some time to find a good spot to cross (I had to hike a few minutes upstream), I found a better place (but just barely). Full concentration mode and after a nerve-wrecking cross, I was on the other side of the stream! I decided to call it a day! Time to put my rain pants, windbreaker, bug net and try to enjoy the end of the afternoon (which with mosquitoes is absolutely impossible 😖).</p>

<p>Total Miles: 964.0 (1542.4km)</p>
<p>My body really seems to understand when it has the time to rest properly. This wasn’t the first time during the PCT that after finishing the day early, I just fall completely asleep. I don’t even remember, but I probably fell asleep around 6:30-7:00pm and had an uninterrupted and deep sleep until 6am. I woke up feeling refreshed!</p>
<p>During the day I met a few day hikers. The Yosemite National Park is very inviting for all types of hikers and the hiking season has just started. One lady came to me and randomly asked: how many blisters did you have already? I replied “three”. She mumbled “good for you” and walked away. Go figure… but at least this made me realize that my right knee and achilles aren’t hurting anymore. After my good night of sleep, I feel like I am 100%!</p>
<p>The first half of the day was a walk in the park. Besides the fact that the trail was very wet (I’m used to wet feet already), it was flat and chill. I was happily enjoying my lunch at noon after having hiked 12 miles already.</p>
<p>The afternoon was a little bit more demanding, but not too much. There was some elevation, but the snow was very scarce. It seems that the snow has been melting for a while here in Yosemite. This is good because it’s much easier (and faster) to hike without snow (as opposed as slushy snow) and the level of the water crossings are not so strong as they were one week ago (by reading the reports of other hikers on the app we use during the PCT). This is good, because today I had two mid-thigh high crossings. Not necessarily scary, but very wet and cold. I wouldn’t want these crossings to be waist or chest high.</p>
<p>The bad thing about the snow melting are the mosquitos 🦟. Today was the first time that I had to: 1) hike wearing my rain pants and wind jacket to protect me from the mosquitos (it was 30°C); 2) wore my head net for hiking and for setting camp; 3) ate dinner inside my tent (which is not recommended 🐻), because it’s just impossible to eat outside. I wonder how I am going to do number two with all these mosquitos lurking around 🍑🦟!</p>
<p>At the end of the day I managed to hike a marathon — it had been a while since the last time! Tomorrow I’ll try again to do two passes in one day and advance 20+ miles.</p>

<p>I had a challenging mission for today: go over two passes on a single day. The fact that the temperature during the night has not been going down below freezing isn’t going to help: from the moment I started hiking around 6am, the snow was already slushy.</p>
<p>The first pass (Island Pass) was the easiest pass so far. You barely notice that it’s a pass. It was quite tiring though because of all the slushy snow. After that, I “rushed” to the next pass: it took me around 5 hours to hike 6 miles, but I finally reached the Donohue Pass late in the afternoon! Lots of slushy snow and no need for any snow gear. Going over Donohue Pass means that now I am in the Yosemite National Park 🏞️!</p>
<p>It’s funny how things become normal. Wearing wet shoes in the morning (good thing they don’t freeze anymore), crossing rivers knee-deep with a 15kg backpack, stopping during the day to dry your tent and sleeping bag. Today I have the feeling that I could keep hiking forever!</p>
<p>Happy with my two passes achievement, I stopped early in the day, around 4:20pm. I cooked dinner and did all my chores earlier than normal and now it’s 5:40pm. I’ll have some rare spare time between writing Polarsteps and going to bed!</p>
<p>When I was cooking dinner, two very polite park rangers came by to check my PCT permit. It’s the first time that I get checked ✅.</p>

<p>Even though I didn’t sleep well during the night, my morning was very good. I woke up around 6am took a shower because why not? And had warm breakfast and coffee at the hotel. When I couldn’t eat anymore, I packed my stuff (I think it’s the heaviest my backpack has ever been), called my beautiful German family 💜 and lazily went to the bus stop to take a trolley to the ski station and from there take a bus back to where I left the trail yesterday.</p>
<p>To my surprise, as soon as I got off the bus I saw Tangent seating on a picnic table having breakfast. He was clear happy and surprised to see me! He told me that Geezer was really scared about what could have happened to me because I disappeared. He explained that Bullfrog and Geezer returned to trail yesterday but he still needs to go back to Mammoth to grab a package at the post office (he couldn’t do it today nor yesterday: weekend).</p>
<p>I stayed talking to Tangent and Rocky (a guy from Lithuania 🇱🇹 who hikes in flip-flops 🩴 and brings a ukulele on top of his gigantic backpack) for an hour or so and started my hiking day around 11:30.</p>
<p>There’s another broken bridge on the PCT so I had to do this tiny reroute. For about 3-4 miles I hiked a bit of the Rainbow Falls Trail then Devil’s Postpile Trail and also a bit of road walk. Both trails were packed with tourists and day hikers: the trails, parking, amenities and campgrounds in this area opened two days ago. I think it’s super cool that people from all ages and backgrounds go out for day hikes like this. Hiking such a pleasurable way of spending time 😊!</p>
<p>Around 1pm I was back at the PCT. I kept hiking for 12 more miles and found a campsite only after 7pm. I saw quite a few new people on the PCT today (around 6-8 people). I was in a good mood and I felt super motivated the whole day. The hike itself was also good: very little snow and dry feet!</p>
<p>There were some incredible views today, including from where I’m camping tonight. This place is unbelievable 🤩!</p>
<p>I have the ambitious plan to do two passes tomorrow morning. The first (Island Pass) should be fairly easy but the second should be a bit challenging. It’s the Donohue Pass. After crossing it, I’ll be hiking for a few days on the Yosemite National Park 🏞️! Let’s see how it goes!</p>

<p>The morning was colder than I expected and the fact that I lost one of my gloves didn’t help. At least the hike to Red’s Meadow, where I should hopefully be able to take the bus to Mammoth, was short. Only 4 miles. Before 8am I had already reached my goal for the day 🏆!</p>
<p>There was nobody else on the bus. The ticket fare was $15 but I only had $7. After seriously suggesting me to hike to Mammoth Lakes over another pass, the bus driver accepted to bring me to town for all my money.</p>
<p>The bus trip took more than I expected and I had to swap buses on a ski station. I asked the second bus driver to drop me at a good coffee shop. Breakfast burrito and café latte 🌯☕️🤤!</p>
<p>The initial plan was to take a zero here, but because of the VVR episode, I arrived this morning instead of yesterday, so I spent the the day doing all the chores I needed to do in town: groceries/resupply, buy gloves 🧤 (they don’t sell only the right hand), do laundry 🧺, dry tent, sleeping bag, socks and shoes and plan the next stretch. I’ll be in the mountains for 8 days starting tomorrow. Let’s hope this time I can make it to the end 🙏!</p>

<p>At 5:30 I was already heading to Silver Pass. This was probably the warmest night since I’m in the Sierra and you can notice that in the morning because the snow is not refreezing overnight. This makes hiking in the snow, specially at the passes, very demanding and time consuming.</p>
<p>I had breakfast at the top of the pass and took my time to descend slowly over the slushy snow. Some of the passes (and Silver Pass is definitely one of them) are more difficult to descend than to ascend. When I stopped for lunch around 2pm the snow had mostly disappeared from the path and I could hike on the actual trail for most of the afternoon!</p>
<p>I’m learning that, to me, hiking in snow is like snowboarding or longboarding: when you’re on the process of learning you’re so scared that you can barely enjoy them. But as you learn, progress and things become more natural, instead of a burden it’s actually fun. Today I hiked the whole day alone again. I listened to music and podcasts most of the day and just accepted that hiking in snow is challenging but can be fun!</p>

<p>VVR (mile 875.7) to mile 883.6</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 3.7 (5.9km) plus 6.7 miles on Lake Edison Trail</p>
<p>Total Miles: 883.6 (1413.8km)</p>
<p>I absolute cannot complain about hiking the wrong trail to VVR. I slept very well and had an enormous breakfast burrito, a big bowl of melons 🍉🍈 and freshly brewed hot coffee ☕️🤤. I could also call Maike 💜, recharge my batteries, uploaded the last posts here to Polarsteps and use a flush toilet 🚽. I didn’t take a shower 😅 nor resupplied at VVR. I’ll do both in 2-3 days when I arrive in Mammoth Lakes 🦣.</p>
<p>Hiking back to the PCT was super chill. The trail was very well maintained and the view around the lake was beautiful all along the way. All of a sudden I was, again, hiking north!</p>
<p>After rejoining the PCT I continued for a few more miles to set up for the next pass, Silver Pass. I’m now camped on top of a boulder, right before the trail gets totally covered by snow. The days have been warm and the temperature at night hasn’t dropped to below freezing for a few days. Tomorrow’s pass will probably be challenging with slushy, soft snow.</p>
<p>There were two very difficult stream crossings today. The last one was almost under a waterfall and I for completely soaked after crossing it. I almost didn’t cross that stream today, but I saw one hiker crossing and it gave me confidence to do it. Glad that I did, so now I’m camping closer to the pass. Also, all my clothes are already dry (besides my shoes…).</p>
<p>In the end, I think the detour to VVR was good. I had to hike additional miles but I divided those miles in two days. A short day like today is always better for the muscles (my right leg still feels sore, both the knee and the achilles) and for the coming days I feel more relaxed to hike on my own pace, since my group (ex-group?) is now probably one day ahead of me. If no big surprises show up, I should arrive in town (Mammoth Lakes) in two days!</p>

<p>Mile 863.7 to VVR (mile 875.7)</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 12 (19.2km) plus 7.2 miles on Bear Ridge Trail to VVR</p>
<p>Total Miles: 875.7 (1401.1km)</p>
<p>The day started perfectly on schedule: at 6 we left camp, around 8 we were having breakfast at the top of Selden Pass. At 9 we started the descent… which took a while.</p>
<p>There was a lot of soft snow. The temperature didn’t drop enough overnight to really refreeze the snow on that side of the mountain. So it was a tough descent, until a point where there was no snow. Then it was the type of hike that I enjoy the most: clear defined trail, challenging but without snow.</p>
<p>After having lunch (me and Geezer only, the other two stayed behind) we started another ascent. At the top, there was a junction with another trail and a nice space to chill. Geezer decided to take a break and wait for the other two and I continued.</p>
<p>Two miles later, when I checked on the map, I actually took the wrong trail at the junction and I was on a side trail called Bear Ridge Trail, leading to Vermilion Valley Resort (VVR). I even started hiking back, but I really didn’t want to go back these past two miles, so I continued towards VVR. When the initial frustration of taking the wrong trail vanished a bit, I started</p>
<p>to enjoy the misfortune: I was pretty sure that I could camp at VVR and maybe even get a meal 😋.</p>
<p>After hiking for three hours I finally arrived at VVR. It was a bit weird to be in “civilization“ all of a sudden but it was not weird at all to have pasta alfredo with salad, beer and ice cream for dinner! The first drink for PCT hikers is free and PCT hikers can camp here for free too! Not bad!</p>
<p>It was fun the last days to hike with a group but unfortunately I’ll probably be on my own for the coming days. I’m considering taking a zero here at VVR to rest my muscles a bit and to enjoy the free stay. But I also would love to be advancing, at least a bit. Let’s see how I feel tomorrow and then I’ll decide.</p>

<p>Piute Pass Trail mile 3.3 to PCT mile 863.7</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 6.5 (10.4km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 863.7 (1381.9km)</p>
<p>Piute Pass was the easiest pass so far. After we crossed it, the trail was very wet and there were multiple stream crossings, so today was wet feet day. The last stream crossing was 10 minutes before camp so my shoes will be soaked (and probably frozen) tomorrow.</p>
<p>After hiking the 17 miles of the Piute Pass Trail, we re-joined the PCT after the broken bridge. We had lunch by the river side and later in the day we already started ascending to our next pass, Selden Pass, that we aim to cross tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Mosquito season is clearly starting. As I write this post inside my tent, I can see at least thirty mosquitos landed on the net of my tent. It’s the first time I camp like this. I’m very thankful that my tent keeps the mosquitos out!</p>
<p>I’m hiking with two poles again and it’s so much better. My right knee still hurts from time to time but I can feel that the weight is better distributed now that I’m using two poles.</p>
<p>Hiking in the Sierra has been very challenging and I can feel how I am demanding more from my body with all the elevation and challenging terrain here. From now on I’ll try to eat substantially more than before, having breakfast, lunch and dinner plus 6-8 snacks during the day. This, of course, means that I have to carry all the extra food weight on my backpack.</p>

<p>Bishop Pass Trailhead to Piute Pass Trailhead + 3.3 miles on Piute Pass Trail</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 0</p>
<p>Total Miles: 832.2 (1331.5km)</p>
<p>We had scheduled our ride back to the trailhead at 7am. I had all my stuff packed so I had time to make coffee and eat a breakfast burrito 🌯 that I ordered yesterday. Good start of the day!</p>
<p>At 8am we (me, Tangent, Bullfrog and Geezer) started our road walk (around 12 miles) from the trailhead that we got off the PCT and the next trailhead that will bring us back to the PCT and skip the part with the broken bridge. Since we knew that we wouldn’t advance much on the trail (we will hike the Piute Pass tomorrow morning), we took it easy. The weather was good for a road walk (a bit cloudy). We were stopped by Outside Jay, a trail angel, and he offered us donuts 🍩. We got two each 😋. After that, around lunch time, we walked a bit out of the way from our path to have coffee and pie at a small cafe. For that, we slackpacked: we left our backpacks on a big bear box and went to the cafe backpackless. We stayed there for about two hours, grabbed our packs and then, finally, we started hiking on the trail again!</p>
<p>We went up for 3.3 miles on the Piute Pass trail and found a nice place to camp for the night. The whole trail is about 17 miles long, so we should be back to the PCT tomorrow 🙃!</p>

I spent the day listening to music, playing Magic on my phone, drinking warm coffee, eating a veggie bowl for lunch, eating 3 burritos for dinner and planning for the next days on the mountains.</p>
<p>I can feel that my knee is not 100% but I can’t wait much longer. Staying here at the THC is one of the known vortexes on the PCT (which is any enjoyable place that pulls the hiker away from trail and makes it difficult for the hiker to come back). Here it feels like we’re in a vacation from</p>
<p>our PCT. A completely different reality of when we’re on trail. Warm showers, flush toilets, food of all kinds, filtered water, socialization, energy and internet. Pure luxury!</p>
<p>At the end of the afternoon we all here had a nice surprise: it was the hostel’s 10th year anniversary. There was (a lot of) cake, cookies and pie for everybody. I went to sleep as full as you can get!</p>
<p>Everything charged, backpack fully packed, equipment repaired! Tomorrow we go back to trail!</p>

<p>PCT Miles: 0</p>
<p>Total Miles: 832.2 (1331.5km)</p>
<p>Today was by far my best zero day since I started the PCT. And big part of it was due the THC (The Hostel California)!</p>
<p>As it has happened before, I didn’t sleep very well. Maybe the bed was too comfortable, maybe I missed my stinky sleeping bag. In any case, I was up at 5 and had a cheap breakfast at Vagabond Inn. I used the morning to slowly pack my stuff, upload some of the posts here to Polarsteps, check next steps on trail, etc. I could feel my right knee hurting and I noticed that I was walking like an old man. At noon I decided to have a 90 minutes massage. It was spectacular and I few like a new human being now! Time to check-in at The Hostel California, where I’ll be spending two nights!</p>
<p>What a crazy place! On the outside the hostel looks cute and colorful. On the inside it’s also cute and colorful and It looks like a hippie community. There must be place for 30+ people here. There are big shared rooms (with instruments, books, movies, skateboards, loan clothes, hiker boxes), big dining area, big kitchen and a big big garden. There are marijuana plants 🪴 everywhere and there’s free weed for guests. Yes, that’s right: it’s a hostel with open bar of weed!</p>
<p>As you can imagine, the vibe here is as chill as it can get. There are a lot of shops, bars, restaurants and services (laundry, post, etc) nearby. I honestly feel like I’m back in São Carlos (the university town that I studied) in a shared student house. I love it!</p>
<p>My biggest mission for today was to fix my hiking pole. I didn’t want to buy a new pair, because it was just one that was broke and also I like my poles (they have shock absorption and I didn’t see a similar model on the shops yet). I went to all the three shops in town, one of them selling used gear. So far, no luck. Seems like I’ll have to spend ~120 dollars to buy a pair of poles worst then mine. Not ideal.</p>
<p>While I was thinking about the best solution, I went to the laundromat and I met Fizz there! Fizz tells me that on the last river crossing he made a mistake and he had to sacrifice one of his poles to the river gods. He was thrilled because he had just found a good deal at the used gear shop and bought a new set for 30 bucks! I guess he was faster than me 😩.</p>
<p>But “hey!”, he says, “maybe we can fix your pole with my old pole, since I don’t need it anymore”. I’m not very hopeful it will work out. We wait for our clothes to be finished and walk back to THC (he is also staying there). When we arrive we met Tangent and he was super happy because he also had broken one of his poles and found a replacement at the hiker box! Why do I always forget the hiker boxes? 🤬! I present you Polenstein!</p>
<p>Fizz gives me his pole and with a little bit of effort I swamp the middle shaft that was broken on mine and… it works!!! I can’t believe it! My hiking poles are fully functional again and it costed me zero money! Fizz refuses to accept any payment for it: “dude, I’m happy myself that I found a good deal and I was going to leave this pole on the hiker box anyways. I’m happy it all worked out!” and he lights a joint. He looks happy and I’m thrilled to have two hiking poles again!</p>
<p>I went out one more time to eat (I somehow forgot to have lunch) and had a gigantic veggie burrito (man, food in America always comes in generous servings). It was already end of the afternoon and I just chilled here and drank my delicious non-alcoholic hazy IPA beer (from Athletic Brewing, one of the best non-alcoholic beers I’ve ever had) until it was hiker’s midnight (9pm) and therefore time to sleep 😴.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I’ll have another zero!</p>

<p>Total Miles: 832.2 (1331.5km)</p>
<p>I cannot believe it: I’m in town!!!</p>
<p>I knew that Tangent, Bullfrog and Geezer usually</p>
<p>start hiking early and I wanted to make sure that I wouldn’t miss the early start. I woke up around 4:30 but everybody was in a chill vibe, given that the day ahead would apparently be easy. We left camp around 6am.</p>
<p>The first 3 hours in the morning were all uphill as we summited to the pass. To go up, we didn’t need traction (spikes or crampons) nor an ice axe. It was the easiest pass so far. On the way down I put my crampons to feel safer. Almost the entire trail going down was under (melting) snow so it was an intense exercise on the legs. I lost contact with my group during the descent and I since I was 99% sure that I would make it to the trailhead, I took my time to hike down.</p>
<p>When I arrived to the trailhead, I didn’t see any of my 3 companions: either they were already gone (meaning they got a hitch to town) or I accidentally passed them on trail without noticing (possible, since it was so much snow that it becomes a “make your own path” situation). In any case, I had to find a ride to town (17 miles). The main problem is that I was not in a street or highway. I was in the trailhead parking lot, meaning that my chances to get a ride were very limited.</p>
<p>On my third attempt to ask for a ride, I went to these three ladies who had just left the trail. It was around 1pm, so I assumed they went for a morning hike. When I asked them if they could by any chance give me a ride to Bishop, one of them promptly replied: of course! Let’s go!</p>
<p>It was an delightful ride talking about the PCT, hiking season, Bishop and what not. Thank you so much Sports Girl and Angie for the ride! They literally left me at the front door of the hostel (which was full, so I ended up in an inn called Vagabond Inn for tonight.</p>
<p>First thing in town? Pizza! Second thing? Shower!</p>
<p>I used the rest of the afternoon to go to the gear shop to buy some things I need: flip flops (no more walking barefoot or with wet shoes at the end of the hiking days), carabiners to better attach things to my backpack and food. I also went to the supermarket to buy more food. I noticed that the amount of food that I was eating in the desert isn’t being enough for the Sierra: I need to eat more. So this time I’m making sure that I pack more food. I think my limit with the bear canister is to bring food for 6 days.</p>
<p>I will take at least one zero here in Bishop (maybe two). Even though I don’t have any blister or serious injury, these part days were TOUGH. My legs are exhausted and they need rest (specially my right knee). I’m very happy that I’m not hiking tomorrow. This is the first reason I came to Bishop.</p>
<p>The second reason, is that I completely ran out of food. When I arrived at the trailhead, I had literally zero food left. I thought I could do 180 miles with the food I brought from Kennedy Meadows 8 days ago. The food lasted one day less than I thought (thank you Carson and Handstand for giving me extra food on trail!) and only made around 140 miles, 25% less than I planned. If in the desert I was doing at least</p>
<p>25 miles a day, in the Sierra I’m doing an average of 17 (and feeling three times more exhausted). Lesson learned!</p>
<p>The third reason is that I need to buy new hiking poles, since I broke one of mine. I can feel in each step that I’m hiking with one pole, specially on elevation. I’m pretty sure that that’s why my right knee is complaining.</p>
<p>Lastly, there’s a bridge over a river 20 miles ahead that is broken and the PCTA (the PCT Association) suggest hikers to do an alternative route to bypass that river. To do this alternative route, you have to leave the trail where I did and re-join through another trail. That’s what I plan to do. There are people trying to cross the river without the bridge. Some of them are succeeding and some do them are being swept away. I’m completely fine not trying it 😊.</p>

<p>Mile 815.1 to mile 832.2, plus 1.5 mile on Bishop Pass Trail</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 17.1 (27.4km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 832.2 (1331.5km)</p>
<p>My body clearly got the memo about the early day yesterday: after I had an early dinner at 4:30pm, I was in bed around 6pm and slept almost all the way through the night. I just had to get out of the tent to pee during the night, but it was totally worth it! The sky was full of stars and absolutely divine! I can’t wait for new moon to do some stargazing here in the Sierra Nevada!</p>
<p>I woke up completely rested and it was my earliest start ever. At 5:26 I was already heading to today’s pass: Mather Pass. After around 45 minutes hiking, I met Tangent, Bullfrog, Geezer and Fizz again. They were discussing the best approach to climb the ice wall to the summit, which lied just in front of us.</p>
<p>Everybody with spikes or crampons on and ice axe in hands, we started the climb. I went to a not very good route and ended up facing something more vertical that I felt comfortable with. I had to use my axe to carve footholds on the snow so I could advance. For maybe half an hour I climbed using my axe as a third point of contact on the frozen mountain. It was nerve wracking but at the end I did it! For me, Mather Pass and Forester Pass are tied as the most difficult passes.</p>
<p>After summiting, it comes an exhausting way down, also in snow. The difference is: now there’s sunshine and the snow is starting to melt.</p>
<p>On the way down I found a nice little pool and went for my first alpine swim! The water was freaking cold but the sun afterwards quickly warmed up! Skinny-dipping in the Sierras ✅!</p>
<p>Since it was a big descent, after a while the snow was completely gone. That means normal hiking speed! So much better! I met again Tangent, Bullfrog and Geezer at lunch time and we hiked together for the whole afternoon. They have a pace similar to mine and they also need to make it to Bishop tomorrow, for food reasons. Perfect!</p>
<p>So, at the moment I’m on a trail (Bishop Pass Trail) to exit the Sierra and go to town (Bishop). This trail is about 13 miles long (I’m 1.5 miles in) and there’s the pass in 4.5 miles. If everything goes according to the plan, tomorrow we will all be in Bishop!</p>

<p>This was the coldest morning so far. I was awake at 5 and left camp at 5:40. There was a layer of frost over my tent and my backpack and my sleeping bag was wet on the outside due to the condensation. That plus wet socks and shoes is always fun!</p>
<p>Going over today’s pass, Pinchot Pass, was quite uneventful. I met Tangent, Bullfrog and Geezer on the way up and going down was also chill wearing the crampons.</p>
<p>After that, and before ascending to the next pass, Mather Pass, I crossed the most challenging stream so far. I had to hike upstream for almost one hour to find a good spot to cross. But all good 👍!</p>
<p>I took a break for an early lunch when I found a good spot with water, shade and a big rock to put my things to dry (tent, sleeping bag, socks). I knew that the day was already close to an end: the ascent to Mather Pass after 12pm was very difficult with the soft snow. I slowly climbed up until it was too much effort for not much gain. Again, it’s much better to do the ascent early in the morning, when the snow is refrozen overnight.</p>
<p>Around 14:30 I met Tangent, Bullfrog and Geezer again. They were having a lunch break. Soon after Fizz also showed up and we chilled together a bit.</p>
<p>I decided that that was it for the day! My body (mainly my legs) would really appreciate an afternoon off. I’m in one of the most beautiful places on the planet, it’s almost mandatory that I slow down and enjoy a bit! I found a nice spot for my tent and slowly I’m doing all the chores, stretching, reorganizing my things and also planning for the coming days. All of that surrounded by gorgeous mountains. Life could be worse 😌.</p>

<p>Mile 790.1 to mile 805.3</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 15.2 (24.3km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 805.3 (1288.5km)</p>
<p>The hiking days in the Sierra Nevada have a structure: you go over a pass as early as possible (because of the snow conditions, frozen = better), then go as close as you can to the next pass. That’s it.</p>
<p>The terrain is also much more complicated. It’s mostly snow, but it can be hard snow, soft snow, slushy snow. There are a lot of parts on the trail that are only rocks, and that’s super hard on ankles and knees. And it’s a lot of elevation.</p>
<p>For the past days I’ve been learning about hiking in conditions completely new to me. I’m also trying to enjoy my time here more (it’s truly beautiful) and to be chill with the fact that I’m doing less miles. That’s perfectly fine.</p>
<p>For a few reasons I decided today that I’m going for my plan B: in three or four days I’ll take the Bishop Pass to exit the Sierra to resupply. It’s all good, everything is fine! I’ll explain the reasons when I get to Bishop.</p>
<p>Well, today I woke up, wore frozen shoes and started my day early, heading to Glen Pass, my second pass in the Sierra. Everything was fine and for my surprise I saw two other hikes when I reached the top of the pass! It had been a while since I saw other human beings.</p>
<p>I briefly talked to them (Tangent and Bullfrog), but they were hiking too fast for me. So I kept going on my own pace. The way down from Glen Pass was a bit harsh in the knees and my right knee started complaining a bit. It doesn’t help much that I’ve been hiking with only one pole (that’s one reason that I’m going to Bishop)</p>
<p>A little before lunch I met another hiker, Fizz, who was still camped. He said that he was taking the day easy, because yesterday was too much for him. When I stopped for lunch, he showed up a few minutes later and we had lunch together.</p>
<p>While we were having lunch, a couple showed up. I talked to them and explained a bit that I was going to Bishop because I really need to resupply and I’m actually running low on food (that’s another reason that I need to go to Bishop).</p>
<p>They (Carson and Handstand) told me that they were not doing the PCT, but a different trail. They had planned to hike for a few days, but they were bailing out because of the amount of snow on their trail. “Do you want our food?”, they asked. Oh yeah!</p>
<p>In the end I got just food for one more day. Now I’m much more confident that I will make to Bishop and resupply. Good 👍!</p>
<p>After lunch I kept hiking (to as close as I can from the next pass, Pinchot Pass) and most of the trail was snow free, but it was very, very wet. Multiple stream crossings and wet feet for the whole afternoon. And that also means frozen shoes and socks tomorrow morning 🥶.</p>
<p>About one hour before I finished the day, I saw Fizz hiking a bit behind me. We hiked the rest of the day together and, in the end, we’re camping side by side tonight: there’s absolutely no other snow-free space nearby.</p>

<p>Mile 772.2 to mile 790.1</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 17.9 (28.6km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 790.1 (1264.2km)</p>
<p>I knew I had a very challenging day ahead.</p>
<p>It was the earliest that I left camp so far, around 5:30. The day started with the river crossing that ended my day yesterday. This morning the stream was indeed slower. I tried first to use a log to cross, but it was frozen and slippery, so I went for it and crossed walking. Refreshing feet (and shoes) wash!</p>
<p>My day was 90% hiking on snow. In the morning, when the snow is still hard, it’s almost as easy as hiking on ground. It took me around three hours to finally put my crampons on. The day was going according to the plan!</p>
<p>Then it was time to cross the Forester Pass. The highest point on the PCT.</p>
<p>There was absolutely no trail to follow. The whole thing was covered in ice. Instead of hiking, the ascend was climbing on ice. It was the first time in my life that I had an ice axe in hand. And I was so glad I did.</p>
<p>I completely ignored the trail, which was full of switchbacks (i.e. zig-zags), and went straight up following some footprints. In one moment, I had to use my ice axe as a third contact point to be able to push myself up. It was freaking crazy scary. Now, looking back, I would say it was fun. In the moment, I was so tense and so scared. I took my time and eventually succeeded on the ascent!</p>
<p>Going down was a completely different story. I glissaded (sit on the snow and slide down🛝) the first part of the descending (that was fun!!), but it was a long way down still after that. The snow was already softening with the sun so it became more difficult to hike.</p>
<p>Besides the early stream crossing, there were three more (actually five, because I miss crossed one river and had to cross back). That plus hiking on the snow means that my feet were wet all day long. Tomorrow seems to be a wear-frozen-socks-and-shoes day…</p>
<p>During the afternoon my mood dropped a bit. I was a little bit miserable with all the wetness and because I was hiking so slow because of the snow. I enjoy hiking fast, I like walking. I don’t necessarily enjoy hiking on snow (but I accept the challenge). I had to, again, stop hiking earlier than I wanted because there wouldn’t be a place to camp if I kept hiking up (full of snow). Tomorrow I’ll try to go over the next pass (Glen Pass) before 7am.</p>
<p>Almost at the end of the day, I had my first encounter with deers 🦌 and for some reason I was super scared. Maybe because it’s a big wild animal and I don’t even remember if I have ever been so close to a wild animal like this. I saw two or three and the last one was not shy at all.

<p>It was a cold night but gladly I had a good night of sleep. Sleeping socks and sleeping pants make all the difference 😴!</p>
<p>There was some frost on my backpack and tent and also my shoes were frozen. It’s really not the best feeling to wear frozen shoes (and socks) on a cold morning.</p>
<p>The morning was tough, but great! Most of the trail was covered in snow, but since it freezes during the night, it’s hard snow in the morning. It’s so much easier to hike in hard snow instead of soft, icy or slushy snow!</p>
<p> Even though I camped alone (and so far I’m camping alone again tonight) I saw a lot of people on trail today. My goal today was to reach the base of the Forester Pass, arguably the most challenging part of the whole PCT. For that, I had to hike 25 miles with a lot of ups and downs.</p>
<p>The problem with that math that used to work in the desert is that there are some parts in the Sierra that you just cannot (or shouldn’t) do at certain times. For example, to go over a high pass (like Forester Pass), you should do it early in the morning, while the snow is still hard. Or if you’re going to cross a river or creek with a strong current, you should also do in the mornings, because the flow will be much calmer since the water freezes overnight.</p>
<p>That was I learned today. After hiking 21.5km, I arrived at a river crossing around 4:30pm. It’s the first time that I face a river crossing that is just too strong to move on, specially alone. Even if there would be more people, I wouldn’t cross it today.</p>
<p>It was the earlier finish of a hiking day so far and also the first time that I don’t reach the goal that I set for the day. I confess that I was a bit disappointed, but now that I cooked, stretched, reorganize my backpack and had time to listen to music and podcasts and it’s not even 19:00, I feel completely fine 🙃.</p>

<p>Until around 4pm my day was absolutely chill. Great hike, beautiful views, no snow to be seen. Since there are no more rattlesnakes to be heard, I could even listen to music for a few hours (I hate listening to music going uphill, but when it’s flat or downhill, I love it!). Everything was perfect. Then the first snow patches showed up.</p>
<p>In the beginning they appeared very sporadically and you could easily go around then. It didn’t take long until I had to hike on snow. Since it was mostly flat, it was fine to hike without the crampons. It was late afternoon and the snow was melting, so easy to slip. And I did a few times. But it was on patch of dirt though that I lost my balance and felt. Nothing serious, silly fall. But somehow I broke one of my hiking poles (the one that was already bent from a previous fall) in half.</p>
<p>I kept hiking with only one pole (what could I do?) until the snow became much more abundant. I made a wise decision and put my crampons on. I hiked probably around two hours with them. Later the snow became patchy only and I took the crampons off.</p>
<p>The last half an hour of hiking was a bit miserable. The melting snow was so soft that my feet would sink in on every step. When I arrived at camp, my shoes, socks and feet were completely damp. I quickly dried my feet and put on dry socks. I’m not really sure how I’m going to wear frozen shoes at 6am tomorrow… The forecast for this night is 25 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>The day cannot start wrong if it starts with all you can eat pancakes 🥞! At 8, I was (almost) fully packed and eating my breakfast. It was a challenge to reorganize things so I can fit the crampons, ice axe and specially the bear canister into my backpack. It was also a challenge to fit my food into the bear canister.</p>
<p>Starting today and for the rest of the Sierra Nevada, it’s mandatory to carry a bear canister, which is a big bear-proof container 🫙. There are two main disadvantages of carrying the bear canister. First, it’s heavy: 1.13kg. Second, it limits the amount of food you can carry. In theory, you should also put on the bear canister scented things like toothpaste or even sunscreen. I forgot to take a picture to show to you how mine looks like. I will do tomorrow (if I remember 😅).</p>
<p>After breakfast (prepared by the mega-friendly Huckleberry), I was ready to go! I said my goodbyes to the other hikers, put my backpack 🎒 on, buckled the hip belt and… the hip belt buckle snaps in two. It’s broken and it’s very visible that there’s no way to fix the buckle.</p>
<p>I’m in the middle of nowhere and I need a new very-specific buckle to repair my backpack. For a moment I think about going without the buckle (and therefore not being able to use the hip belt), but I remembered the mantra “make wise decisions” and carrying 15kg on your shoulders only is definitely not wise. The solution would be to order a new buckle online… I was already preparing myself mentally to have a few zeros until the new buckle arrives.</p>
<p>I went to the general store and they even have a buckle, but it’s too small, it not even half of the width of the strap. Then I went to the hiker box (a hiker box is a big box where hikers leave what they don’t want or need anymore, so other hikers can use) and there was a big old backpack there! The backpack itself couldn’t be used, but I could remove the hip belt buckle! Believe or not, somebody had this idea before: there were no buckles anymore.</p>
<p>My last resort was to check with Charlie Brown if he had the buckle. He didn’t have any on his shop, but he said that he was about to receive a box with some spare parts. Maybe later today or tomorrow that box would arrive and maybe there could be a hip belt buckle there. A lot of maybes.</p>
<p>He went to the general store to check for his mail and for his surprise (and mine) his box had just arrived this morning. I couldn’t believe my eyes when he shows me the <em>one</em> hip belt buckle that came in the box!</p>
<p>Forty minutes later, after Charlie Brown stitched 🪡 the new buckle (and refuse to receive any payment for that) I was ready to go! I put my backpack on, buckle my hip belt and… everything is perfect 🤩!</p>
<p>I started hiking at 11:30 and hiked almost non-stop until 19, after almost 20 miles. There was already a lot of altitude change today (mostly uphill) and I’m sleeping at almost 10.000 feet of altitude. The wind is becoming colder and colder (in contrast with the warm wind from the desert) and I saw already a few snow patches. I’m clearly entering the Sierra 😬.</p>

<p>PCT Miles: 0</p>
<p>Total Miles: 703.4 (1125.4km)</p>
<p>I was feeling surprisingly good in the morning. I woke up around 6 and went to the porch of the general store (which basically IS Kennedy Meadows). There, at 7am, they serve breakfast: all you can eat pancakes and coffee. That’s a good way to start a zero!</p>
<p>It was good to finally have internet again. I could upload the last days here on Polarsteps and call Maike 💜. I could also charge all my devices: phone, watch, headlamp, gps and power bank. Fully loaded for the coming 8~10 in the Sierra!</p>
<p>Spending a zero day camping on the backyard</p>
<p>of a general store (with focus almost exclusively on PCT hikers) is surely interesting. During the day you can resupply, drink a beer, have a burger, fix your gear, send or receive packages. On the backyard there’s also an outfitter store, selling literally any piece of clothing or equipment you might need for the Sierra. I spend almost four hours (!!!) on this store (which is inside a trailer, super tiny) talking to the owner Charlie Brown. I asked every possible question I could imagine about crossing the Sierra with safety. He seemed happy to help and answer my questions.</p>
<p>Starting tomorrow for the coming 500 miles or so, I’m required to carry a bear can. So, besides resupply it, I also bought one today (surprise, at the general store). Lastly, I made some improvements to my gear to be better prepared for the colder weather and be safer hiking on snowy/icy ground: I replaced my micro spikes for proper crampons, bought an ice axe 🪓 (for safety), another puff jacket, gloves 🧤, a pair of merino bottom base layer (to sleep on) and waterproof socks 🧦. I also replaced the thin sleeping mat that I was using for a thicker, warmer one.</p>
<p>Other than that, the atmosphere here is pretty festive. There’s clearly a vibe of accomplishment, after finishing the desert part. You can also feel a subtle apprehension in the air. We are all about to start the most challenging part of the PCT after all.</p>
<p>My plan is to start hiking tomorrow after breakfast 🥞. I’m bringing food for 8-9 days. My plan A is to hike 180 miles in one go. My plan B is to stop earlier and hitch to a town. In theory I don’t need to resupply, but if I need to go to town for whatever reason, there will be a few places that I can hitch to town. My plan AA is to go a bit further and reach Mammoth Lakes 🦣, 200 miles away.</p>
<p>Sierra Nevada, here I come!</p>

<p>Mile 667.7 to Kennedy Meadows South</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 35.7 (57.1km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 703.4 (1125.4km)</p>
<p>I cannot hide that yesterday I was inspired by my conversations with Chezwick. I feel like, somehow, hiking with him transferred a bit of his determination and discipline to me.</p>
<p>Today I was hiking before 6am and my plan was to break my hiking record from yesterday and hike 30 miles. That sounded plausible, so I went for it. The idea was to get as close as possible to Kennedy Meadows South (KMS), so I could arrive there tomorrow morning. Things turned out a bit differently though.</p>
<p>Kennedy Meadows South is probably the most famous “town” in the whole PCT. The “town” is composed literally by these three shops (a General Store, a bar/restaurant and an outfitter) that serve PCT hikers during the hiking season. KMS is also the divider between the first part of the PCT (desert) and the most challenging part, the Sierra Nevada.</p>
<p>Stopping at KMS is almost mandatory for PCT hikers. First, for resupply. Second, to fix, change or improve the gear, since things will be very different in the coming 400 miles than they were in the past 700. It will be much colder, lots of snow, much higher altitude and there will be a lot of elevation gain/loss every single day. Hikers also gather here to team up (it’s not advised to go to the Sierra alone). You need to bring micro spikes, an ice axe and it’s compulsory to have a bear can (I’ll tell more about the bear can later).</p>
<p>Back to my day: it was an intense day, since I was pushing myself since early morning, but nothing absurd. I was 99% sure that I was going to stop when I reached 30 miles and leave the remaining 6 for tomorrow. I arrived at the camping spot around 7pm, but apparently it’s a popular camping spot (close to a stream) and it was a bit too crowded. There was this girl with a punctured sleeping mattress surrounded by 4-5 guys trying to help. There was someone complaining that mice had just eaten their food and there was this other guy trying to lecture everybody about the Sierra. I don’t even know from where those people came from, but there was too much going on for me. I refilled my water and very spontaneously decided to keep going until Kennedy Meadows. That would mean that I was going to hike a bit in the dark, which is something that I’m usually not comfortable with. In my mind I could hear Chezwick telling me that this is why we’re here: to overcome these fears. Little by little, one by one.</p>
<p>My short night hike was absolutely incredible. I didn’t even need to use my headlamp because the moon 🌕 was so so so bright. And knowing that I was about to finish the day hiking more than 50km and breaking my record from yesterday made me feel invincible!</p>
<p>I’m proud of myself. It was a big day and I feel like I’m improving physically while still making wise decisions, day by day.</p>
<p>And by the way: Bye, desert! Thanks for the great time but I really doubt that I’ll miss you!</p>

<p>Mile 639.6 to mile 667.7</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 28.1 (45km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 667.7(1068.8km)</p>
<p>It was a cold and windy night but I slept very well. So well that I woke up after 6 and didn’t leave camp until 6:40, which usually is not ideal.</p>
<p>It turned out though that after a few steps I stop for a quick chat with this hiker who was sitting on a rock smoking a cigarette. Chezwick is his name. He started the PCT on May 2nd (!) and is doing an average of 35 miles per day. He finishes his cigarette and we hike together for the whole morning, around 12 miles for a quick lunch break. He eats cold soaked something (maybe knorr pasta?) with a lot of olive oil and SPAM 🤢. I eat a double cheese double peanut butter pita bread 😋.</p>
<p>This is the fourth time Chezwick is doing the PCT. He finished it three times already and he wants to finish this time in less than 80 days. Then, he will attempt to, before the end of the year, thru-hike both the CDT (Continental Divide Trail) and the AT (Appalachian Trail) and aim to beat the record of the fastest self-supported triple-crowner in a single calendar year! (self-supported: no assistance from friends or family; triple-crowner: someone who thru-hikes the AT, CDT and PCT)</p>
<p>After lunch and refilling water (third water cache in a row) we parted ways since the next part was an uphill and I usually take my time on those. After a steep climb of almost three hours, I meet Chezwick at the top of the mountain, sitting on a rock, smoking a cigarette (that’s when I took the selfie). You climbed pretty fast, he says, and we once more hike for about three hours, talking about hiking and motivation and why we do those things and why wouldn’t we do those things. Around 7pm we arrived at my camping spot. Chezwick had a quick “half ciggy” pause (sitting on a rock) and we said goodbye. I don’t think I’ll ever meet him again, but I’m so thankful that I had the chance to spend this day hiking with him.</p>
<p>On one of the many topics we chatted, I told Chezwick that I was a little bit anxious about the Sierras. There are so many unknowns and challenges that I can’t even imagine that I feel scared about it. “You got this, Bruno”, he said. “I can see that you really like to hike and that’s what’s important. The Sierra is the most beautiful place on Earth and all the challenges will be worth it. It’s going to be tough, but it’s going to incredible, I promise”. That’s exactly what I needed to hear.</p>
<p>This day and the inspiring conversations with Chezwick set my mood up and made me excited about the next stage on the PCT. The only situations in the desert that I didn’t feel comfortable were related to snow and/or ice. And this is what the Sierra is about: snow and ice (and elevation and beautiful views). Come, Sierra! I’m ready for you!</p>
<p>Talking about records, at the end of the day I broke my distance record for a single day hiking the PCT (or ever): 45km!</p>
<p>PS: bonus picture of my feet moments before I go to sleep.</p>

<p>Beautiful morning! I left camp before 6am and the sun was already out. It’s very easy to observe that the sun is rising earlier and earlier.</p>
<p>Today was an interesting day in the sense that, since yesterday, the next two water sources (that provide water for ~40 miles) are two caches maintained by a trail angel 👼. I have no idea what hikers would do without those water caches.</p>
<p>During the night the winds were crazy. Surprisingly in the morning it was just a breeze but it picked up in the afternoon and there were some strong gusts that were a little bit scary. I really hope this wind thing is something from this region and that in the Sierra things will be calmer</p>
<p>I was feeling much more energized than yesterday and hiked in a very good pace, even though there were quite some uphills. As I eat, the backpack is becoming lighter. Also I realized that if I keep the daily mileage around 24 miles instead of 20, I can arrive in Kennedy Meadows South (the official end of the desert and beginning of the Sierra) one day earlier than I planned. I did well yesterday and did well today, so things are on track. For tomorrow I’ll have to hike at least 25 miles because of water reasons. Good chances that I arrive in KMS on Thursday instead of Friday 🏃🏻‍♂️!</p>
<p>I only saw 6 people today and it was the first time I saw every single one of them. So far from all the hikers I encountered since Tehachapi, I’m the only one who’s bringing food to go straight to KMS. The other option — that seems preferred by the others — is to hike once more to some town and resupply. I’m happy that I’m going in one go.</p>

I’ve done a fair amount of 10 before 10s and usually I hike for 6-7 hours (around 15 miles) before taking a break for lunch. Then in the afternoon I go with the flow, just hiking until I find a good place to camp (around 7pm).</p>
<p>Today was completely the opposite.</p>
<p>It was a tough morning. I was carrying 4 liters of water (and my backpack is still full of food). The first water source was in 16 miles. It felt to me that it took forever for these miles to pass.</p>
<p>But eventually they did. I’m back in the mountains so there’s a lot of elevation, which disguises a bit the effort to hike a mile. The full backpack seems to weight three times more when you’re hiking uphill.</p>
<p>When I arrived at the water source (a pipe coming out of nowhere), I took a longer break than usual. I had lunch, cameled up (drink a lot of water) and chatted a bit with Aragorn (danish, father of 3, quit his job and is doing the PCT) and Dust (german, attempted last year but gave up because of the high amount of snow. Came back this year to finish what he started). These weird names, by the way, are “trail names”. I’ll talk about trail names in a post soon.</p>
<p>Taking a longer break (also it took a long time to filter the not-so-clean water) recharged my batteries a bit. I was planning to do around 21 miles today, but I decided to keep hiking for 4 miles more. Hiking in the afternoon was much more pleasant (and flat) so in the end it turned out to be a good day 🙃.</p>

<p>Tehachapi to mile 587.5</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 21 (33.6km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 587.5 (940km)</p>
<p>This morning I spent two hours having breakfast at the hotel. Granola, waffles, bagels, muffins, scrambled eggs, juices and coffee. I was weirdly proud on how much I could eat without feeling full.</p>
<p>Very conveniently there’s a bus 🚌 to the trailhead where I left off. Precisely on time, at 9:30 🕤 it arrived and 20 minutes later I was hiking the PCT. Even better, the ride was free 🆓!</p>
<p>The first eight miles would be an ascent and the next water source was in 16 miles. Besides food for seven days, I was carrying 3 liters of water plus 2 cans of nonalcoholic beer (leftovers from yesterday). It was not a bad idea to have kind-of-cold beer for the first two hydration stops of the day.</p>
<p>Miraculously, hiking uphill under the sun wasn’t so bad because of the strong wind. Maybe a bit annoying but at least not so exhausting. I was in good mood, feeling rested, so the day just flew by.</p>
<p>Sixteen miles later, at the water source, I checked and the next water would be in 20 miles! That means packing 5 liters of water. I decided to have dinner at the water source, so I wouldn’t need to use water to cook later at camp. I cooked a bag of dehydrated mashed potatoes that is meant for 8 portions. After cooked, it weighed about 1.2kg. One point two kilos of food for dinner. And I was not even so full after that. Crazy!</p>
<p>I kept walking for 5 more miles until I found a nice campsite where other 4-5 people are also camping. Since I didn’t have to cook, I used my time to have a good stretch. It’s now 20:52, only 8 minutes for hiker’s midnight! 😴😴😴</p>

<p>Mile 562.0 to mile 566.5</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 4.5 (7.2km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 566.5 (906.4km)</p>
<p>I woke up this morning under an impressive wind gust. My tent was shaking but thankfully it held up very well. Time to pack and walk the last 5 miles to town! It’s a Nearo!</p>
<p>I had left in my food bag only two cliff bars and I had no water. It’s so much more comfortable hiking with less weight. You feel like you’re flying 🕊️!</p>
<p>When I arrived at the highway 🛣️ that brings you to Tehachapi, I had no idea 🤷 what to do. Obviously I couldn’t try to hitch on the highway, so I sat on an area that seemed that cars could stop and tried to text trail angels from a list that I had seen a few miles back.</p>
<p>After 20 minutes or so, this truck comes from</p>
<p>Tehachapi, stops close to where I was and drops off two PCT hikers. I asked hey are you going back to Tehachapi? The driver replied yeah, I sure am! Can you give me a ride? Of course!</p>
<p>Unfortunately I don’t remember the name of the driver. Before going to Tehachapi he had to stop at the “Dump” which is a crazy humongous place where people dump absolutely all kinds of trash. He had some bags of grass from his lawn mowing that needed to be dumped there.</p>
<p>After that he dropped me at Walmart and refused to take any money for gas. I was coming this way already, he said. Awesome! It was not even 10am and I was already in town. Time to start resupplying!</p>
<p>Walmart was 15 minutes walk from the hotel that I chose to spend the night (the one with free warm breakfast). So after buying 80% of my resupply for the next seven days, I came to the hotel and chilled there (while recharging all my electronics which for the first time in this trip were all depleted). At 12:00 I had lavash wrap 🌯 and fries 🍟 and a delicious baklava from a mediterranean restaurant close by. I could check in early at the hotel at 13:00 and could finally take a shower 🧼!</p>
<p>The rest of the day was divided into doing the usual town duties: laundry (even though I believe my yellow sun hoodie will never look not dirty again. The picture is <em>after</em> it was washed!), duct taping my tent, food bag and my shorts 🩳 (hopefully it will work better than my stitches 🪡), going to the sports shop to buy more food and back to walmart once more to buy vegetables for dinner and other resupply items like toothpaste and tissues.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I start my last stretch in the desert 🌵! I’m hoping to hike the next 140 miles in seven days 🤞.</p>

<p>Mile 535.0 to mile 562.0</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 27 (43.2km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 562 (899km)</p>
<p>I camped in a big camping area last night and I found it strange that it was so empty (there was just one couple other than me). I got a very nice spot protected from the wind and close to the water!</p>
<p>Soon after midnight people started to arrive 🤨 and then everything made sense: Most hikers are choosing to hike very early in the morning and/or late afternoon/evening to avoid the heat. The aqueduct seems to be a known rough part of the trail (for those who don’t have an umbrella ☂️😉).</p>
<p>I found out that yesterday I entered a wind farm territory that’s open for PCT hikers. I had never heard this term before, but whoever decided to build a wind farm here had a very good idea. It winds a lot.</p>
<p>It was like on the first days of the PCT where it’s not only sunny, hot and shadeless but it’s also dry and the hot wind sucks all the moisture from you. You just sweat and feel thirsty all the time. And usually when you drink, the water it’s lukewarm 🙃.</p>
<p>At mile 549 there was such a cool spot maintained by a trail angel that looks like a bar, with chairs 🪑, a library 📚 with a few games and books, cookies and ramen (!) and most importantly: water. I made my lunch break there and met a few other hikers: Hammer, Chad, Red Lentils and No Map.</p>
<p>Nothing changed for the afternoon: hot, windy and dry. I was literally in the middle of hundreds of wind turbines (or whatever these are called).</p>
<p>The highlight of the day happened 4 miles before my final campsite. Right before a road crossing, this man was sitting in a camp chair by his truck and he offered me a cold gatorade (omg thanks) and we chatted a bit. He, Magicman, does this for nine years: he goes driving from Campo (where the PCT starts) to Oregon stopping here and there for a few days to offer cold drinks to PCT hikers. He stands the freaking whole day by his car where he has giant coolers full of cold drinks and he gives them for free to random stranger PCT hikers because he likes it. He never hiked the PCT himself and he doesn’t accept any kind of donation.</p>
<p>I’m camping tonight in the middle of the wind farm hiding from the wind behind a juniper (?) tree. Now that I constantly now where North is, I know that the wind is coming from West and North-West so I positioned my tent accordingly to be more protected from the wind. I’m feeling like I’m the smartest person alive! But I must say that the wind is quite strong and my tent is unfortunately shaking much more than I wanted.</p>

<p>Thank you everyone who has been following (and liking and commenting!) my adventure here on Polarsteps for one month already!!! It’s been a real pleasure to share my days and to receive your energy back! Thank you!</p>

<p>The night was a success, I slept very well, no condensation on my sleeping bag and no attack to the food bag! Great!</p>
<p>The morning was no different. Before 6 I had left camp already and started the day on a very calm morning hike. The weather was good, the wind was good, the path was mellow. I looked ahead at the map and it seemed that the whole day would be a big flat walk. I like flat walks! Time for some music!</p>
<p>The problem with this specific flat walk is that it was in the middle of the Mojave desert with absolutely no shade. After 10am, what was a “good weather” became extreme heat reflected back to your body by the sand. There were specific places where I needed to get water to make sure I had enough to keep me hydrated.</p>
<p>Since it was a flat walk, I stowed my poles and used my umbrella to protect me from the sun. It’s the first time I use the umbrella like this and it worked better than I expected. In the end it wasn’t an easy hike, but given my early start time and good cadence walking on the flat, I arrived at camp, 24 miles later, before 5pm. Time to slowly stretch, collect and filter water, pitch the tent, cook dinner, brush my teeth, recharge electronics, plan for tomorrow and sleep 😴 .</p>

<p>Waking up at 5:30, leaving camp before 6, short and smart pauses. 10 before 10. Carrying just enough water to the next source.</p>
<p>Today I played the PCT by the book!</p>
<p>Yesterday, I forgot to mention: I provisionally fixed my tent (and my food bag) with the same tape I used to do bandages. When I get in town I’ll try to buy some proper tape.</p>
<p>I only saw two hikers (a couple) today during the whole day. When I arrived at the camping spot that I intended to spend the night though, there were more than 20 people camping there! Some of them are cowboy camping (camping without a tent, only sleeping mat and bag) because there’s not enough space. I found a little spot that literally only fits my tent (without the rain cover) further down the trail. Let’s see how it goes!</p>

<p>Something that I knew that inevitably was going to happen (and for sure will happen again), but you always hope that it just doesn’t happen: I had my tent invaded by rodents during the night!</p>
<p>I only found out this morning, because of the huge hole on the net of my tent and also on my food bag. Apparently they went for trail mix, not much of a loss, but this is definitely not the best way to start the day.</p>
<p>I was telling this story later in the day while having lunch with Lizard, Spider and Peaches 🦎🕷️🍑 (the only three people that i’ve seen during the whole day) and Lizard said that two nights ago she had a mice in her sleeping bag! I prefer a thousand times to share my food from time to time with the little thieves. From now on my food bag stays outside the tent. At least next time my tent doesn’t end up with another hole ⛺️🕳️ .</p>
<p>I have 78 miles between me and my next resupply (in Tehachapi) and I have just enough food for 4 days (and 3 nights). I’ll try to do big miles in the coming 3 days so I can arrive in Tehachapi on Friday as early as possible and eat in town.</p>

<p>LA Camping (mile 444.3) to mile 465.6</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 21.3 (34.1km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 465.6 (745km)</p>
<p>Taking full advantage of having access to running water and a flush toilet, I had a very slow morning. I also wanted to check the general store that opened at 8am: because I got so much food for free yesterday, I thought about extending my next resupply for three more days. For that, though, I needed to find food for one more day either at this store or in 10 miles in a tiny town called Agua Dulce.</p>
<p>The general store was very unimpressive. I bought 2 frozen burritos for breakfast (they had a microwave) and 4 snickers. They also had free coffee for hikers!</p>
<p>Before leaving the campground I swapped my shoes and now I’m officially on my second pair, Two Goats ✌️🐐. It’s very impressive how a new pair of shoes make all the difference. The size (half a size up from my previous one) is perfect.</p>
<p>I arrived at Agua Dulce at 1:30pm and I was starving. Because of the double burrito 🌯🌯 in the morning I didn’t snack anything for 4 hours, but now I was very hungry. There was a Mexican restaurant literally on the PCT. If I had lunch here then I could have snacks for dinner and my food problem regarding the resupply would be solved!</p>
<p>I didn’t realize, but today is Mother’s day here in the US (in Brazil too!). At the Mexican restaurant they were having a all you can eat buffet. Yes, that’s right. Me, a starving hiker, in a all you can eat mexican buffet.</p>
<p>My first plate had 8 quesadillas on it. Plus rice, and beans and peppers and eggs with cheese. I don’t remember the last time I ate so much in a single meal. And that was only the first plate.</p>
<p>I was already fine after eating the first plate, but why not having a second? They had salads and fruits and waffles (?!) and sweets… I ended up having four plates and 1.5 liter of iced tea.</p>
<p>Hiking after that meal in the desert at 30 degrees uphill was an experience that I recommend to anyone. For the first two hours after having lunch I couldn’t even drink water, so full I was. But everything was under control and now that I’m in my tent writing this and seeing in retrospect, I think it was good that I ate a generous amount 😁. I didn’t need to eat dinner so my food is perfect to hike for the next 100 miles without resupplying!</p>
<p>Another snake encounter, some rock views, tunnels and art were also part of this busy day 😊!</p>

<p>Mile 418.4 to LA Camping</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 25.9 (41.4km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 444.3 (710.9km)</p>
<p>Last night I camped in a kind of sketchy place, close to some power lines in a construction site. Before 6am today I had already left “camp” and started hiking.</p>
<p>For the first 3/4 of the day, the pattern from yesterday repeated: going up and going down, managing water consumption, taking regular pauses for snacks. The days have been warm but bearable 🐻 the water sources frequent enough. Not much to tell until I was about 4 miles from camp. I was feeling good, all my blisters are healed, the massage and the zero surely helped my body to rest and recover.</p>
<p>I was already planning to have a break for a snack, drink water and rest a bit before the last two hiking hours of the day when I saw a sign 🪧 for a hiker’s party happening today with free food and drinks!</p>
<p>That was exactly it: a big table with all kinds of snacks plus sandwiches and burritos. Also cold beer, soda and gatorade! I don’t know how, I don’t know why, but everything for free.</p>
<p>I spend 45 minutes eating apple, m&#x26;ms, trail mix, nuts, all types of cookies, celery, carrots, two cliff bars, doritos, raisins and drinking an ice cold orange gatorade!</p>
<p>Everything was good but as it usually happens with me in parties, I soon got bored and decided to continue hiking. I thanked the trail angels and kept going. Even with the party pause, it was still around 5pm after I hiked the last 4 miles that I had planned for today. That’s a bit too early to stop hiking so I kept pushing for 2 more hours and ended up at a proper camping place. They have showers, toilets and even have towels for the PCT hikers! So an unexpected and unplanned shower happened!</p>
<p>I was about to write that the score now is 4 showers vs 3 pizzas, but someone here at the camping site just offered me more than half of a vegetarian pizza they couldn’t handle. So I guess the score now is tied in 4 showers and 4 pizzas 😊!</p>

<p>When you hike long distances there are always days that go by and nothing extraordinary happen, specially when you get used to the logistics of hiking. Days like today: the sun was shining, it started with an ascent and later a decent. I had to make sure to collect water at the right sources and manage my consumption, I ate five cliffs bar during the day and had watermelon electronola for lunch. I had an encounter with a snake. Late afternoon there was a glimpse of a storm but it was soon gone and the sun was back. At the end of the day I hiked a marathon.</p>
<p>Just a normal hiking day 😊!</p>

<p>Knowing it would be almost a whole day of road walk, I already stowed my hiking poles and put my headphones on since the beginning of the day. It was a bit of s late start (around 10am) because I had to wait to get a ride from my host. But as soon as I was hiking again I had a very good day enjoying the walk (even being on asphalt), with no need to be always checking the map and without having to pay so much attention regarding snakes 🐍 or anything, really. For the first half of the day, the road was closed for cars. For the second half, I saw 4 or 5 cars, max. It was super chill and the day just passed by 🎶🎶.</p>
<p>My backpack is a bit too heavy. I bought food at the supermarket that is not freeze dried and therefore it weight much more. Tonight I’m having two of those for dinner, so it’s almost 600g less to carry!</p>

<p>It’s zero day!</p>
<p>Yesterday in the evening the owner of this place that I’m staying for two nights offered me and the other guests (two other couples) to do laundry for us! This sounds like music to a thru-hiker (specially because there’s no public laundry in Wrightwood).</p>
<p>This morning I had pizza for breakfast (I ended up eating the same pizza for dinner yesterday, breakfast, lunch and dinner today) and headed to the town center (which is literally a street with 4-5 shops and a few bars and restaurants). I resupplied both at the supermarket and at the equipment shop and I also grabbed my new pair of shoes that I had ordered back in Big Bear. Same shoes, same color, half a size up. I’m calling them Two Goats.</p>
<p>Hiking-wise I feel super good. All my blisters are gone and I don’t feel any pain. I believe I’ve been eating the best I can, drinking properly and being careful regarding the sun. Because of that I’ll try to have a bit more mileage without resupplying for the coming days/weeks. Tomorrow I leave with food for eight days! I’m hoping water won’t be much of a problem so I can carry less water and balance the weight out.</p>
<p>After a lot of thoughts and considerations, tomorrow I’ll do an alternate road trail instead of climbing up to Mount Baden-Powell. I chose that because I’m fully loaded (with snacks and supplies 🎶) and I would need to carry a lot of water. It’s around 9400 feet and it’s all steep and icy, up and down. I’m fine with road walk!</p>
<p>Another reason I chose to road walk is that I want to finally hike listening to music. So far, I haven’t hiked a single minute listening to music, mostly so I could be aware of rattlesnakes. This morning, going back and forth to the town center, I could listen to music and it felt super good (thanks for Lemonade, Tessa!). I want to do the same tomorrow.</p>
<p>A side effect of this decision is that I will carry my new shoes but I’ll walk on my old shoes: they’re currently very not-grippy but this is not a problem for road walk. As soon as I go back to the trail I’ll swap them (and eventually discard my old pair of shoes). I also decided that I’m not mailing forward any equipment (like the micro spikes — they won’t be necessary until mile ~700). I’ll just carry everything.</p>
<p>The place I’m staying is kind of a day spa with sauna and massages upon request. I had a very well deserved one hour full body massage this afternoon and it was excellent! I’ve also soaked my feet in epsom salt 🧂 and it’s amazing how my feet don’t look like they’ve been hiking non-stop for three weeks! ✨🦶✨</p>
<p>Feeling well-rested and motivated for the coming days!</p>

<p>Mile 351.8 to Wrightwood</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 17.5 (28km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 369.3 (590.9km)</p>
<p>I made a sightly miscalculation yesterday. I thought today would be a 10 miles day, but it was in reality 17.5 (instead of hiking until close to the next town, Wrightwood, I had to hike until the highway, past Wrightwood). The biggest problem with this miscalculations is the potential lack of food and water. In this case, I lacked both.</p>
<p>I only had about 3 liters for the whole day (I drink 1 liter every 4 or 5 miles) and I had no food other than 3 cliff bars. The cherry on top 🍒 was the fact that the trail today kept ascending until 8500 feet and for some obscure reason then snow and ice in this region don’t melt even if it’s crazy hot. Time for some ice/slush hiking and microspikes on!</p>
<p>A bit before 4pm I was finished and ready to hitch a ride to town. That didn’t take me much effort as I was offered two rides by two different people. Fun Fact, a hiker that hiked the PCT in 2021 and it was just section hiking this year, gave me a ride to my accommodation for the next two nights (tomorrow is a zero!)</p>
<p>I’ve just had a shower (my third on the PCT, after three weeks!) and I’m waiting for a ride to the pizza place to have my third pizza on the PCT. Maybe I should keep this tradition: for every shower on trail, I get myself a pizza! 🚿🍕👍</p>

<p>What a beautiful morning! It was delightful to watch the sunrise 🌄 while packing up to start the day!</p>
<p>I was kind of excited about going to the Mc Donald’s  but the closer I got, the more I realized that I actually didn’t really feel like junk food. I heard that there was a “Fruit Dude” that sells big cups of fresh fruit nearby. My plan was to go there first and then to Mc Donald’s, so at least I had some healthy stuff on my stomach.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the Fruit Dude was not there (although the stand was), so I went for plan B and decided to eat a Mc-anything-veggie. Except that they didn’t have any veggie burgers, so I ended up ordering two big fries, a caramel sundae, coffee and ice tea. I devoured the fries and the sunday 🤤! Finally I had good internet so I could also facetime Maike 💜.</p>
<p>I was not very amused with my breakfast so far. There was a group of hikertrash chilling close to the Mc Donald’s and I joined them. From there I saw that the Fruit Dude was back to his stand!</p>
<p>Biggest fruit cup I’ve ever seen. I couldn’t finish it! It was so good to eat so much fresh fruit 🍉🥭🥥!</p>
<p>The next step of the day was to hike ten more miles (it had taken me 10 miles to get to Mc Donald’s) uphill and without water sources for the next 25 miles. Time to camel up and refill with 6.5 liters of free filtered water at Mc Donald’s! (this and the flush toilet were by far the best things I got at Mc Donald’s today.)</p>
<p>Refuelled with salt, sugar, caffeine, filtered water, vitamins and love I continued with my day. No surprises in the afternoon, just a continuous hike up carrying a lot of water. I made camp around 6pm and tomorrow I should arrive in town!</p>

<p>Total Miles: 332.3 (531.7km)</p>
<p>It was quite windy during the night and apparently it rained, because my tent and part of my backpack were wet in the morning. I didn’t see a thing, I slept like a baby.</p>
<p>The morning was beautiful and the hike was quite pleasant during the whole day. I had to do two river crossings, one barefoot and another with my shoes which made me hike with wet feet for half of the day. There wasn’t much elevation again and the landscape was pretty beautiful, specially in the afternoon, when the PCT went around a big lake.</p>
<p>The weather was quite good for most part of the day, except when all of a sudden some dark</p>
<p>clouds showed up. But in the end it was just some cold wind and after a while the sun appeared again.</p>
<p>I noticed that I’ve been eating much more than two weeks ago. I dare to say that I’m currently eating twice what I was eating before. This is a problem because of costs and weight carried. But we’ll think about this later. Tomorrow we feast! (tomorrow I’ll pass by a famous landmark of the PCT: the McDonalds at Cajon Pass)</p>

<p>Mile 285.6 to mile 310.5</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 24.9 (39.8km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 310.5 (496.8km)</p>
<p>I slept super good. I even overslept a bit and left camp around 7:30. Before leaving, I saw Hanne (a girl from Belgium who’s part of the first group I hiked with) and we talked a bit. She will hike the PCT only for 2 months, so she’s skipping some parts. She skipped Mission Creek so she didn’t get sick. I heard today that Clara (she’s +/- 2 days behind me) also got sick with the water 😞.</p>
<p>There were some river crossings today. Each crossing comes with its own challenges. Some you have to cross with your shoes, some it’s better to go barefoot. Sometimes you can find rocks and tree branches and somehow make your way to the other side without getting wet. Sometimes it’s better to use the hiking poles, sometimes it’s better to store them in the backpack. On every crossing you have to remember to make wise decisions.</p>
<p>Now that there’s not much elevation gain and water isn’t an issue, I’ve been able to hike a little bit faster.  Even though today for whatever reason I hiked a bit backwards by accident, I was able to fish the day with almost 25 miles. That’s a record for this trip 🏆!</p>
<p>When I arrived at where I intended to camp, all spots were taken. I had to keep walking a bit more and found a very solitary place for my tent. It’s super cool and the sound of the water is very loud here. Also, it’s winding a bit too much for my taste. Hopefully the wind won’t blow my tent away 🙏!</p>

<p>Big Bear City to mile 285.6</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 19.5 (31.2km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 285.6 (457km)</p>
<p>If yesterday before bedtime Kenny’s house looked like a quarantine ward, this morning everybody was feeling much, much better. The day started slowly but soon we were making breakfast! Kenny made chili potatoes and sausages, Chilli Beans piloted the waffle machine, Google made scrambled eggs and Mermaid and me prepared a gigantic fruit salad!</p>
<p>I was the only one in the house that was not going to take a zero: because I was feeling fine yesterday, I had time to resupply and I was feeling physically very good, so there’s no need to take a zero. Kenny drove me back to the trail head around noon and I continued hiking north.</p>
<p>My plan was to hike 12-14 miles, but the trail was super simple and chill. The weather was also good, sunny but with lots of shade. I kept a good pace for more or less seven hours and ended up hiking almost 20 miles. On the way, I crossed paths with Max (the french dude whom I walked together on the first days)! We had a quick talk but both of us were on a mission to crush some miles. I finished my day a bit after 7, camping close to a water stream.</p>
<p>About the outbreak yesterday: it seems that nobody before yesterday got sick (and I don’t know today — I don’t have internet at the moment to check). To me it still sounds weird that it’s a virus. Nobody had fever and everybody was 90% fine after 24 hours. It looks more like poisoning or an intoxication of some sort. I was absolutely lucky to have skipped whatever part of the creek that was contaminated! This morning before I left Kenny’s, we heard stories about helicopters and ambulances having to rescue sick hikers on the trail!</p>

<p>Arrastre Trail Camp (mile 256.2) to Big Bear City</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 9.9 (15.8km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 266.1 (425.8km)</p>
<p>What a cold night! I think this was the first night that it was below freezing 🥶 brrrrr. Waking up at 5:30, getting out of my warm sleeping bag and unpitching the tent when it’s cold is so so difficult. The tent poles feel like ice bars in your hands. It was the first</p>
<p>morning so far that I started hiking with my puff jacket on (plus gloves and windbreaker).</p>
<p>It didn’t take long though for the sun to come up and for me so start peeling off my layers. At 7:30 or so I was already hiking on full desert mode.</p>
<p>The hiking day itself was pretty short and uneventful. At 10 I was already waiting for a trail angel (Kenny) to pick me up. I needed to resupply for the coming days and my initial plan was to take a zero tomorrow in Big Bear. Kenny brought me to his place, where he hosts hikers. Such a crazy place! There was freshly made breakfast (french toast 🍞, eggs 🍳 and chili potatoes 🌶️🥔! I also met some of people that I had been hiking with in the past days and some of the people that I met last night on camp. With one similarity between them all: they were all sick. And when I say sick, I mean <em>sick</em>.</p>
<p>One of the assumptions is that it could have been the water from the demoniac mission creek from the past days. It’s weird because everybody filters the water. I for sure drank from the creek at some point (although I don’t remember when or how much).</p>
<p>The other possibility would be a virus that’s infecting everyone. I found this quite fascinating since it seems that everybody got sick at the exact same time. BUT there’s this norovirus thing going on here in the US and the symptoms seem to match.</p>
<p>Also… the norovirus is waterborne and our filters don’t filter virus, only bacteria 🦠🤯.</p>
<p>We’re 13 people at Kenny’s Place and so far only 4 are not sick. Fingers crossed, knocking on wood!</p>
<p>In any case, during the day I went to resupply. I thought Big Bear would be cosy like Idyllwild, but it was more like a bigger town, bigger streets kind of vibe. I went to the gear shop and to the supermarket and fully resupplied for 5-6 days. Kenny, such a nice dude, drove me and other healthy hikers back and forth.</p>
<p>So, I decided that I won’t take a zero tomorrow. Physically I feel fine and I see no strong reason to stay here. Unless — fingers crossed, knocking on wood — I feel sick tonight.</p>

<p>After an exhausting day, I finally slept well. Weirdly I woke up not in the best mood ever. I left camp at 6:30 and took me a few hours to really get going. The day started with more hiking up the creek’s bed until finally I was on the trail for real. There were parts of tre trail that were destroyed and some bushwhacking and “make your own path” were necessary. It was kind of fun. If I wouldn’t be so tired from yesterday I would probably have enjoyed much much more.</p>
<p>The day was beautiful and because I was high in the mountains (above 8000 feet for most of the day) it was not so warm. There was even some ice/snow but they were perfectly manageable, no need for spikes and no falls!</p>
<p>Even though there was nothing particularly special (finally!), I love days like today. No stress, nothing scary, just walking, walking and walking 🚶‍♂️.</p>

<p>You know your day will be awesome when it’s not even 6am and you’re already barefoot, crossing an ice cold stream. Silly me, taking out my shoes to cross the stream…</p>
<p>I learned yesterday that in 2023 a hurricane (Hillary) completely devastated this part of the PCT. In short, there’s one part of the PCT (around 10 miles) that is completely gone and in order to advance you have to hike upstream on a creek. Sounds like fun!</p>
<p>And it was actually fun. For the first 2-3 hours, but not the whole day. Today’s hike looked the same throughout the day: hiking uphill, on a very difficult and annoying terrain (rocks, rocks everywhere) and crossing a water stream back and forth for almost a hundred times! At least carrying water was not a problem today…</p>
<p>Today was also the first day that I had the full rattlesnake experience: being rattled at, almost having a heart attack, and then seeing the monster looking at you as if it want to eat you alive. All of that with that rattle that sounds like a death sentence. At least, with rattlesnakes the theory works: just go back, give it some space and at some point it’ll go away. That’s exactly what happened 😮‍💨. I also saw another rattlesnake later, but that one was more chill (see picture).</p>
<p>After like 8 hours of hiking in the exact same scenario (11 hours total), I finally got out of the creek and finally rejoined the undamaged part of the PCT. In the end I found a very nice spot to camp tonight.</p>
<p>PS: my little toes look like chickpeas ready to be peeled 🫣!</p>

<p>I’m definitely in the desert again.</p>
<p>I started walking around 7am, with a beautiful sunrise 🌄. This beautiful sunrise soon became unbearable heat with absolutely no shade to hide.</p>
<p>I had a water situation since I lost my 3 water bottles. Being in the desert again means caring about water consumption and refill. I was counting on a water cache that trail angels put under the bridge that intersects the I-10 highway. And thankfully the cache was there. I used the shade also to have lunch and camel up.</p>
<p>4 miles after, my maps shows that there should be an office of a windmill company where they welcome PCT hikers! I went there and it’s pretty cool: they have sodas, snacks, water (and later I found out that inside another door they also have ice cream and clean flush toilets 🤩! Hikers paradise! I took 3 500ml water bottles, so now I have capacity of 3.5 liters.</p>
<p>The rest of the day was pretty much like the beginning: hiking in the desert (I was rattled at! I didn’t see the rattler, but you can hear in one of the videos the rattle), managing water consumption, trying (unsuccessfully) to hide from the sun.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I decided to go a bit off trail to a place called Whitewater Preserve, that also welcome hikers. Such a nice place! One of the coolest places I’ve camped so far 🤙! And the best price ever: nada!</p>

<p>Strawberry Campground (mile 183.3) to mile 201.1</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 17.8 (28.5km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 201.1 (321.8km)</p>
<p>I didn’t sleep well again, so I was a bit lazy in the morning (and also it was very cold). I left camp around 7:30 prepared for my day full of snow and ice 🧊.</p>
<p>After a few miles I already had to put my spikes on and I kept them on for at least four hours. In the beginning of the day it was easy to hike on the ice, because everything was kind of refrozen from the night. But as I advanced in the day (today was very sunny, gorgeous!), the ice and snow started to melt and everything became slippery. Hiking on slippery ice is such a mental process!</p>
<p>And it just takes one microsecond of distraction for something to go wrong. That was exactly what happened to me today.</p>
<p>At some point I had removed my spikes because the</p>
<p>snow was gone. After maybe 15-20 minutes, the snow was back on the trail and I decided to put the spikes back on (which is a tedious process because you have to find a place to sit, take off the backpack, etc). And I’m so happy that I did.</p>
<p>The trail was full of snow but it also was fully exposed to the sun. That made all the ice and snow very slushy, very not grippy. I can’t even remember how, but I stepped in a slippery part and in a fraction of a second I was sliding down a “gentle” slope. Gentle because it was not a cliff or anything, but it took me 5-6 seconds to be able to stop the fall. At the cost of my knuckles and one of my hiking poles. Nothing serious happened to me. Later I found out that all my three water bottles had fallen from my backpack during my own fall. What a morning! (you can watch me talking about the accident on the last video of this post.)</p>
<p>After I realized what had just happened I was a bit down (and thirsty). For the rest of the morning I hiked fully focused on the path, taking very cautious step after step. Around 1pm I arrived in this nice picnic area and stopped for lunch and to tape my knuckles. After this break, the snow and ice were really gone,l so no spikes were needed anymore. In fact, it became very sunny and warm and “desertic” again. I don’t think I’m going to see snow again for the next 500 miles. For the next four hours (12 miles) the path was much easier and downhill. I made camp at 6pm.</p>
<p>For the coming 4 days, until I’m in town again, my full water capacity is only 2 liters. Let’s hope that it’s going to be enough 🤞!</p>

<p>Idyllwild to Strawberry Campground (mile 183.3)</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 3.9 (6.2km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 183.3 (293.3km)</p>
<p>We call a day like today a nearo. It’s near zero.</p>
<p>For some reason I didn’t sleep well. Maybe my body rejected the idea of me sleeping in a king bed on my zero. To compensate that I had raspberry ice cream and pizza for breakfast. I actually bought the ice cream because I want to use the cup as a container for musli/granola! Let’s see if it works 🙃.</p>
<p>After breakfast I sent a message on the “Idyllwild Trail Angels” facebook group asking for a ride to the trailhead. One guy responded within one hour (thanks Leo!) saying the he would pick me up at the inn at 11 and drive me to the trailhead of Devil’s Slide, so I can continue the PCT from where I left. Sweet!</p>
<p>The difference between packing up in a room or in the campground is that in a room you’re never sure that you packed everything. In the campground, you just look back and make sure there’s nothing left behind.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Hanne (a girl from Belgium who started hiking together on the first day with Clara, Max and Marie/Mary) texted me because she also wanted to go to Devil’s Slide. That was awesome because I was not looking very forward to hike up the snow-covered trail alone. Everything worked perfectly and Leo also picked her up. I hiked most of my short day with her.</p>
<p>As soon as we started we met a legend from the PCT, SanJacJon. It’s a guy that voluntarily climbs up the San Jacinto Peak every week to report the current status of the track. I literally watched his video (from April 18th) this morning where he reported the conditions of the Fuller Ridge, the trail that I’ll hike tomorrow. As a matter of fact, I decided to hike it tomorrow and not today because of his report.</p>
<p>Since the Devil’s Slide (2.5 mile long, 1600 feet of elevation) is not part of the PCT, both the hike down two days ago and the hike up are not added to the total miles hiked 🥲. At least this time I could actually see the path and even though there was a lot of snow, both of us didn’t use the spikes. We took our time to hike steady and slowly. It was a beautiful hike, even though the fog decided to show up at some point.</p>
<p>After arriving at Saddle Junction (where the PCT continued) we kept hiking slow, following the path on the snow until we reached 9000 feet of altitude. Even though I’m carrying food for 7-8 days, I don’t need to carry more than one liter of water at a time, since water here up in the mountains is abundant because of all the snow melting, so the weight of my backpack is ok.</p>
<p>Around 4pm I arrived at my campsite. Hanne kept hiking for a few more miles. I pitched my tent, had an early dinner (Pad Thai) and now, 17:44, I’m already ready to sleep 😴.</p>
<p>PS: I had a hole on the phone pocket of my shorts. I have a tiny sewing kit 🪡 with me and I made a beautiful repair myself!</p>

<p>It’s funny because you would think that on a zero you will rest. But in reality, a zero day is used to do all the city chores you can’t while your in the wild.</p>
<p>I woke up early as usual, but I was still very tired and very sleepy. My body was stiff from both the intensity of yesterday and the lack of stretching (usually I stretch before and after hiking and yesterday I skipped the latter). When I got up to use the bathroom, I realized that my socks and shoes were wet. And it was 4 degrees outside! Wet socks on, wet shoes on and here we go to start our zero day!</p>
<p>Idyllwild is such a cute town. There are plenty of places to have breakfast (by plenty I mean like five) and I decided to have a breakfast burrito 🌯! Oh breakfast burrito! An old favorite of mine! I decided to go to Mama’s Egg House 🤱🥚🏠!</p>
<p>And who do I meet there? Clara!! It was so so good to see a familiar face and catch up about the last days. She’s having a good time so far and also taking a zero. She actually hitched from PVC to resupply and buy micro spikes (good idea!) and is coming back there tomorrow to continue her hike. And we had the conversation over a proper freshly brewed coffee. Life is already getting better!</p>
<p>From there I came back to the campground to call Maike 💜, pack and go to the Ranger’s office to ask for a permit to enter and camp the San Jacinto Wilderness Area (I’ll explain why when I get at Big Bear Lake at mile 266). Mary, the ranger that signed my permit was the most adorable person and so enthusiastic about her job. It’s so good to be treated with so much care and attention. Thank you, Mary! You definitely made my day better!</p>
<p>From there I went to the gear shop to resupply and buy some additional equipment. I upgraded my water bladder (that I I use for filtering water) and added a nice elastic chord outside my backpack so I can hang things a little bit easier. Other than that, just the usual food/gas/electrolytes/snacks shopping. And I got a whole celery stalk as a gift!</p>
<p>Finished with that, I went to a café to have another coffee and rest a bit before I could check-in into my room. There I run into Clara again, which was awesome to kill time. From there I checked in and got my room!</p>
<p>It seems that as soon as I entered my room, my backpack exploded everywhere! I went immediately to shower and wore my rain pants and jacket, so I could do laundry. The rest of my day was divided between laundry, cleaning my equipment (sleeping bag and tent), going to the supermarket, ordering a pizza (I ate it with a full bag of salad, I’m calling this pizzalata) and repacking everything again. All of a sudden it’s already 8 in the eventing and I’m almost ready to sleep. I lighted up the fireplace and before I could even enjoy it I was already dreaming 😴.</p>

<p>I had just finished to pitch my tent and was admiring the beautiful view of the sun, clouds and mountains when…</p>
<p>SNAP! I hear something break and the metallic sound makes me sure it’s not just another branch.</p>
<p>I look back and my tent pole is broken, my tent flapping and swinging with the wind as if it was a weird flag attached to the ground. It took me a few seconds (or minutes) to assess the situation. The forecast is 4 degrees (surely colder here on top of the mountain), sustained winds of 40 mph (64km/h), cold and wet feet and no tent. It seemed difficult not to break the only rule I’m trying to follow here. What could I possibly do?</p>
<p>“Hiiii Bruuuunoooo” I hear. Holy shit, I’m delirious I think. I’m so exhausted that I’m hearing the wind saying my name.</p>
<p>“Bruno!!!” I hear, but now it’s a different voice. I can’t believe what I’m seeing.</p>
<p>Toni, Noelle, Tenor and Virginia were crossing the last patch of snow before where I am. When I met them earlier today we brielfly exchanged our plans: I was going to Idyllwild via the Devil’s Slide trail and they would be camping in the last camp spot, which is where we are now. My plan obviously changed and I’m so happy to see them!</p>
<p>Dude you’re crazy to camp here with this storm, Tenor said. We’ll push to Idyllwild, he continued.</p>
<p>Once more I couldn’t believe what I was listening.</p>
<p>I looked at each one of them. They also looked exhausted. How are you guys possibly going to Idyllwild still? It’s going to take at least two hours and the path ahead is really full of snow, I asked. We know, but we won’t be here in this storm tonight. We’ll push it though, one of them said.</p>
<p>Can I please join you guys? I need five minutes to disassemble this… tent?</p>
<p>Of course! The four of them replied in unison.</p>
<p>There I was. 5:30 in the evening, exhausted and still a good 2-3 hours of hike ahead of me. Let’s do this!</p>
<p>The evening was stunning. The sky was clear and even the wind was milder. And even though we had to hike mainly on ice and snow, it was not sketchy or dangerous at all (I guess).</p>
<p>I was happy to be with other people that had more experience than me in these conditions. Also, whenever something would happen, like somebody sinking knee deep jnto the snow, sliding or even falling, instead of thinking “oh shit I’m going to die” there was always a “are you ok?” checkup followed by some laughs. I didn’t realize that, but I missed laughing.</p>
<p>The problems was that we were slow. Besides the terrain not being the friendliest and us being super tired, we were stopping more than normal to take pictures. There was a beautiful sunset and nobody wanted to miss it. Until someone realizes that at the sunset, the sun… sets! We’re going to be in the darkness!</p>
<p>We started rushing a bit, but there was no way to espace our destiny. At some point some commanded: everybody: head lamps on! Yes, sir 🫡! I put my head lamp on and… yeah, I remembered that it had been on probably for the whole day and past night by accident, so I have no light. I stayed in the middle of the pack and thankfully their lights were enough to show me the way.</p>
<p>Then it was 7, 7:30, 8… and we were still in the mountain. At 8 we started our decent and at 8:30 there was — finally! — no more snow. We took off our micro spikes and started almost to run downhill. At 9:30 in the evening, after hiking in the complete darkness for more than one and a half hour, we arrived at the trailhead parking lot where a trail angel was waiting to pick us up. We couldn’t believe it (at least I couldn’t!). We all high fived and prepared to go to town!</p>
<p>Except…</p>
<p>We were five people. The trail angel rightfully only wanted to bring 4 at a time. Because I was new</p>
<p>in the group (and I was so thankful that they “rescued” me) I decided to stay. The trail</p>
<p>angel said she would be back in 20-30 minutes to pick me up. Before leaving, the trail angel said: please be safe, I’ll be back for you. And be careful with mountain lions, we do have some in this region.</p>
<p>BE CAREFUL WITH WHAT WHY DID YOU TELL</p>
<p>ME THIS?</p>
<p>And off they went.</p>
<p>It was pitch dark (no head lamp!) and getting very cold, very quickly, but I had no other choice. I wore all my clothes (literally!) and waited in the dark. I could barely use my phone because I didn’t want to take my hands out of my pockets. It was the longest 20 minutes of my life. I felt that I was in a movie terror. A crime scene. A mountain lion’s dinning table. Every single sound in the mountains (and I was surrounded by them) caused a shiver down my spine. And I couldn’t even see it. Was it a mountain lion or just a leaf falling? Who knows.</p>
<p>Finally my trail angel arrived (omg thank you for coming back). When I said thank you so much she said it’s my pleasure Bruno, I said I was coming back for you, I came back the fastest as I could.</p>
<p>It was 10 o’clock already, one hour past hiker’s midnight. I didn’t have a place to sleep in town. All the inns and hotels were already closed, since usually they don’t get late night unannounced guests. I went to the city’s campground. I couldn’t find nobody to check-in (and pay) so I just entered, found a spot and set my tent. In the end I could book a tent spot online, so at least I could sleep without possibly being woken up at 6am by the campground patrol.</p>
<p>Before falling in deep sleep, I cooked water and mixed everything else that I had in a single meal. My spaghetti-couscous-olive-oil-peanut-butter was absolutely delicious!</p>
<p>Even though I was depleted, I couldn’t fall asleep. My mind wanted to think about all the bad things, all the risks, all the exhaustion. I put in my mind that I wouldn’t think about anything or make any plans. I put my headphones on and fell asleep almost instantly.</p>

<p>Mile 140.6 to mile 162.7 (Cedar Spring)</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 22.1 (35.4km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 162.7 (260.3km)</p>
<p>The day ended yesterday and started today with wind, a lot of wind. And it was windy for the whole day.</p>
<p>There are very few water sources in this part of the trail. I was excited to go to Paradise Valley Café, 1 mile off trail, so I could refill my water (and eat a vegetarian burger just in case). Also, I needed to go to get my micro spikes that I ordered last Sunday. Depending on a lot of factors, sometimes you need micro spikes (and an ice axe 🪓) for this part of the trail and sometimes not. Because I’m still trying my best not to die, I decided to carry micro spikes from today on.</p>
<p>It was a very efficient morning (10 before 10!) and Paradise Valley Café (PVC) didn’t disappoint: I had a nice beer, at least four cups of ice cold water, burger and fries. I also found my package 📦 amongst hundreds of others and refilled my water until the next water source.</p>
<p>I had to quickly go back to trail because I still had more than 12 miles ahead of me and today I was not carrying enough water to dry camp, so I had to make it to my next water source: a spring (Cedar Sprint) 1 mile off trail. Everything seemed fine.</p>
<p>Until the storm started to approach.</p>
<p>After leaving PVC I was hiking slow because I was heavy with all the water and the elevation went from 4 to 7 thousand feet 🦶 (whatever that is in meters). But the more I hiked the more I felt that I was hiking straight into the stormy clouds that were gathering. At some point the sun was hidden and the wind was blowing violently and it started to become chilly. I still had at least 3 hours to hike. I was so concerned about the storm that my first sight of a rattlesnake didn’t bother me much (and it was very close). I had only one goal: arrive at the spring before it started raining or getting too dark.</p>
<p>After rushing a bit and feeling the wind pushing me to the side for the last hour or so, I arrived around 18 and gladly there was enough space close to the spring for my tent. I’m happy that I could camp here, it seems more protected from the wind. The wind is so strong that it sounds like ocean waves crashing into rocks.</p>
<p>Hopefully tomorrow the wind won’t be as strong, specially during the day. I still need to ascend 2000 feet and hike 16 miles with all the water for the day. My plan is to finish the day hiking off trail (through another trail called Devil’s Slide 👿🛝) into Idyllwild, my next resupply stop!</p>
<p>(today I hiked 3 miles off trail: 2 miles to and from</p>
<p>PVC plus 1 mile to Cedar Spring. For a PCT thru hiker there are only a few things worse than hiking non-PCT miles…)</p>

<p>Mile 162.7 (Cedar Spring) to Idyllwild</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 16.7 (26.7km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 179.4 (287km)</p>
<p>I didn’t sleep very well with all the wind and the anticipation that today I would have the most challenging day on the PCT so far. Oh boy if only I knew…</p>
<p>I decided to have a coffee and a tea to warm me up before I left camp. One of the obvious advantages of camping close to a spring is that you have unlimited water. I wanted to wait for the wind to become less intense and for the cold and condensation on my tent to dissipate a bit.</p>
<p>Wearing for the first time my fleece and my gloves 🧤 I left camp at 8. 1 mile hiking up back to trail 🤬 and then off I went to… the middle of the storm.</p>
<p>To be fair, it didn’t rain (or snow or hail) but the wind was so strong and so cold that at some times I had to stop hiking just to keep my balance. Today I was not hiding under the trees for shade. I was hiding behind rocks or bushes for wind protection.</p>
<p>Not only it was a steep climb of more than 2000 feet to a maximum elevation on 8800 feet in was also not carrying so much water. I was hoping not to drink too much since it was not so warm. The problem is that the ascent took much more than I thought. It was super steep (and windy!!). Not only the physical effort was huge, I tried my best to keep it slow to prevent altitude sickness.</p>
<p>There were trees and branches and rocks spread all over the path. To be honest it really made the hike more fun (jump over or crawl under a tree, finding ways of going around impenetrable blobs of branches, etc) but it also made it so much slow. I was hiking under 1.5 mile an hour and that was simply not going to work.</p>
<p>Around lunchtime I passed this group of 4 people. As I usually do, I quickly stop to introduce myself, wish them a good day and carry on with my bike. Hi, I’m Bruno, I said. Toni, Noelle, Tenor and Virginia they replied! Have I nice day, I wished to them. You too, they replied. Oh by the way there’s something on in your fanny pack, Toni yelled. I noticed that</p>
<p>my headlamp was on for some reason. The light was very faint, so it probably was on for the whole</p>
<p>morning (and past evening?). I turned it off and yelled back: thank you!</p>
<p>At mile 169, I saw what I was absolutely not looking forward: snow and ice on the path. The first test was actually a steep cliff edge. Remembering the first rule (don’t die!) I decided to put my micro spikes on. But before, time to read the manual as I had no idea what I was doing… It turned out to be pretty straightforward and there I was, all micro spiked and ready for some ice and snow action!</p>
<p>Everything went fine. There was not thaaat amount</p>
<p>of snow and I felt safe all the time. It was just impossible to look down at the cliffs. Every step in inclined snow took me forever, which I don’t regret.</p>
<p>Even the sun decided to show up (after I was above the clouds). It was still very cold and windy but sunny. Maybe too sunny. I started drinking much more water and I was so relieved when I found a spring from melted snow running alongside a rock wall. Time to refill!</p>
<p>Because it took me so long to hike today, I decided not to go to Idylllwild and instead camp on top of the mountain. I heard that the descend to Idyllwild was a bit steep and there was a considerable amount of ice and snow. Better to do it tomorrow morning when my body is rested.</p>
<p>I couldn’t wait to make camp. I didn’t have more lunch food and I ate all my snacks during the day. The only thing left was a knorr spaghetti and a couscous, both I had to cook. I was really looking forward to a warm meal!</p>
<p>At 5 I finally found the last place to camp before the descend to Idyllwild. It was a beautiful place with a beautiful view to both sides of the mountain. I was alone and there was not much protection from the wind though, so I pitched my tent with some struggle. I used big rocks to secure my tent stakes in place. Everything good, time for some well deserved rest and warm food!</p>
<p>What a crazy day! While I was pitching my tent I thought that this was probably the most adventurous and challenging hike day I’ve ever had. So exhausting but so rewarding!</p>
<p>It indeed ended up being the most adventurous day of my life. But not for what had happened already, but for what was still to happen…</p>
<p>to be continued…</p>

<p>Mile 119.6 to mile 140.6</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 21.0 (33.6km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 140.6 (224.9km)</p>
<p>One week on the PCT! And still alive!! 🥳</p>
<p>Even though the night had been quite warm, I woke up a bit cold. As soon as I opened my tent, I realized why! Everything was very humid as I was in the middle of a dense mist. I tried to pack as soon as I could but the beauty of my surroundings made me a bit catatonic. I left camp at 6:40.</p>
<p>The morning was gorgeous! That was the most beautiful day I had in the PCT so far. For hours I could see from above the fog trapped in the valley. As the sun slowly showed up, the views of the top of the mountains over the fog were unbelievably beautiful.</p>
<p>Not only the most beautiful day, but today was also the day where I had to carry 7.5 liters of water! I didn’t want to trust one of the water sources (a cistern that was rated as “dry and full of dead animals”), so my alternative was to hike 24 miles plus dry camping in one go. But for that, one of the other water sources, called Mike’s Place and maintained upon donations, had to be working. My morning was divided between hiking, admiring the surroundings and praying for water.</p>
<p>At mile 127, I saw a sign that I was hoping for: the directions to Mike’s Place. A few more minutes walking off trail and I could see the big water tank. And it had water. Maravilha!</p>
<p>Time to camel up (drink water at a source until you can’t anymore) and fill every single bottle I had. Total 7.5 liters and a backpack that I almost couldn’t lift. I think it weighted something around 17-18 kilos… 🥵</p>
<p>Slowly but steadily I kept hiking and very consciously drinking water. In a way I had to save water to be sure I’d  have water for 24 miles plus dry camping, but I also wanted to get rid of the weight as soon as I could.</p>
<p>I’m so happy that Bloopu is gone. My left foot is much much better. I’m not sure I could have carried so much weight if Bloopu was there. Unfortunately it seems that some relative of Bloopu is starting to show up on my right little toe. I’m sure you all are very interested in this topic so I will keep you posted!</p>
<p>Around 5pm and after 21 miles I decided to make camp. Maybe I didn’t choose the best place because it’s super windy, but there’s absolutely no chance that I walk another single mile today. I’m glad that I have a proper tent and not only a tarp like some people hiking the PCT.</p>
<p>Tomorrow there’s a famous Café that’s accessible hiking a bit off trail and I’m hoping to eat real food. Or as close as real food as you can get at an American Café 😅!</p>

<p>Ranchita Bodega (mile 101.2) to mile 119.6</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 18.4 (29.4km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 119.6 (191.4km)</p>
<p>I had my first slow morning today. Mike would drive me back to the trailhead at 9, so I could chill until then. I called Maike 💜 and used the last chance to top up the batteries of all the electronic stuff. I decided to bring just enough water until the next water source (my backpack is super heavy with the food).</p>
<p>A bit before 9 Mike showed up and brought me and two more hikers to the trailhead. Selfie time!</p>
<p>My little toe was feeling great and I walked on quite a good pace for about 4 hours. At some point, there were some very curious cows on a mud path. It was all a bit wet with some puddles here and there. I tried to jump over one of the puddles… I slipped and ended up falling on my back on the ground. Everything’s fine, nobody’s hurt but my whole back and my backpack were now covered by a mix of mud and cow’s juice. I hiked 3 miles smelling like cow and completely dirty.</p>
<p>After one and a half hour having to deal with</p>
<p>myself covered in that dark brown blerbh, there was a creek and I could wash everything. I wore everything back wet, which was actually quite refreshing. In less than an hour everything was dry again 🥵.</p>
<p>The path today was much more beautiful and less exposed than the previous days. There was a lot of oak trees providing shade and the ground was much softer. There were also some parts of desert 🌵 of course.</p>
<p>Even though I was pretty pissed with the cow’s juice situation, my overall mood was very good today. There will be a stretch of 12 miles without water and I’ll have to dry camp tonight. That means that at some point I was carrying my full capacity of water: 5.5 liters. This is the heaviest my backpack has ever been!</p>
<p>Even though the last miles of the day were uphill, everything was fine. I found a nice camp spot up in the mountain and I have just watched perhaps the most beautiful sunset of my life. Look at this sky!</p>

I want to leave Ranchita with enough food until Idyllwild, 77 miles ahead. That’s about 4 to 5 days. Besides food, I also bought more fuel ⛽️ for my stove, sunscreen (my calves and lips are a bit sunburnt). The highlight is the dehydrated peanut butter 🤤🤤!</p>
<p>It was time for me and Bloopu to part ways. I had a needle and thread 🪡 that I got from Scout and Frodo and I knew the theory behind popping a blister and draining it out so you can keep hiking without it bursting into your dirty socks. I learned this before going to my first Camino de Santiago in 2017 but I very rarely have blisters (knock on wood 🤜💥🪵 ) and never needed to do it.</p>
<p>After sterilizing the needle with fire and alcohol, I popped Bloopu and the blood started to leak through the thread. I left it for a few minutes and it was mostly dry! As I ran the remaining thread through the blister it sucked all the blood away! Perfect! I patched everything with plasters and so long, Bloopu 👋!</p>
<p>I also fully charged my devices, since I’ll be with little to no electricity and internet during the coming 4-5 days!</p>
<p>Time for a good night of sleep with sheets, pillow and unlimited filtered water. What a life!</p>

<p>Mile 86.6 to mile 101.2</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 14.6 (23.4km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 101.2 (161.9km)</p>
<p>It was my warmest night in the PCT so far. I tried to use my sleeping bag only as a blanket, but it was still too warm. I could feel the old salt in my body mixing with new sweat. Not the best night of sleep, but that ended up being good: I enjoyed the night sky in the desert, with almost full moon. The moon so bright, no clouds and a sky full of stars ✨!</p>
<p>After I woke up I had to make a decision: I only had one last meal and 15 miles ahead of me. I could eat now or save it for later. I decided to eat it before hiking, so at 5:30 I was eating pasta with chili for breakfast 😋!</p>
<p>The sunrise in the desert is absolutely beautiful 🌄!</p>
<p>Soon after I started hiking, Bloopu started to complain and I noticed that I was limping. Not a very good sign. After 6 miles, a very welcomed trail magic: water cache. I gulped down 1 liter and stocked up 2 more. I had now 2.5 liter for the remaining stretch of 10 miles. 28 degrees and no shade. No food. Limping.</p>
<p>Maybe the water was miraculous, because as soon as I left the water cache Bloopu got better. I could hike on a good pace and the more I hiked the more I drank, the lighter my backpack became. For the last 2 miles, I was carrying no water and no food. I felt like I was flying.</p>
<p>I crossed the 100 mile mark (4% of the PCT 🥲) and soon after I found myself in a parking lot. I knew that there’s a mini market 4 miles off trail, but you can call for a ride. I did and 10 minutes later Mike came to pick me and another hiker up. Brought us to the Ranchita Bodega!</p>
<p>I will resupply here for the coming 4-5 days. It’s going to be a challenge: hike with so much added weight.</p>
<p>I decided to stay in a room here for tonight. That means that I had my first shower! It’s amazing how many layers of dirt your body can accumulate.</p>
<p>I’ve just done groceries and washed my clothes (that’s why i’m wearing my rain pants) and I’m chilling on a hammock listening to Red Hot Chili Peppers playing at the shop. Life could be worse ✌️!</p>

<p>Mile 63.7 to mile 86.6</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 22.9 (36.6km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 86.6 (138.6km)</p>
<p>After sleeping for 11 hours (!!!) I woke up around 5 and right before 6 I was already hiking. Not much because I wanted to, but because I needed to beat the heat. Besides the forecast of 30 degrees and almost no shade, this section doesn’t have many water sources.</p>
<p>I hiked mostly alone (yay!) and did another 10 before 10, properly celebrated with my first snake sighting! It was not a rattle snake though, just a normal scary terrifying long random snake 🐍.</p>
<p>I kept pushing until Scissors Crossing, where most hikers hitch to Julian, a hiker’s town. I didn’t want to go to Julian, but I was out of water. Then, I experienced my first trail magic: right under a bridge (one of the few places with a shade today) there was a water cache! It’s a known cache, replenished every day (multiple times a day) by trail angels. While I was there having my lunch and resting (it was a pretty tough and warm morning), I saw someone coming with more water, tangerines, bananas and cold gatorades and leaving everything there for the hikers. I find it truly amazing and inspiring that people do that!</p>
<p>After a good two hours break it was time for the toughest part for me so far: the next water cache should be 14 miles ahead, which basically meant that I had to dry camp tonight: camping without a water source nearby. I started my afternoon carrying 5 liters of water, which almost doubles the weight of my backpack. For the next 10 miles I had absolutely no shade and I sweated like a madman. I can see stains of salt everywhere on my clothes. My face literally has a white layer on top 🧂!</p>
<p>I’m eating my dinner as I write this and now there’s only one meal left on my backpack! My plan is tomorrow to first not die and second hitch to store and resupply for the coming 4 days!</p>
<p>And yes, Marlos. Today I used my little shovel 😌</p>
<p>the heat hits hard</p>
<p>hard hits the heat</p>
<p>was that another snake</p>
<p>or just my heartbeat?</p>
<p>the scorching desert burns</p>
<p>my strength seems to fail</p>
<p>while the dry wind</p>
<p>sucks all the moisture away</p>
<p>but then there are angels,</p>
<p>who bring magic to the trail</p>
<p>my hope is restored</p>
<p>my spirits are up again</p>
<p>i quench my thirst and once more</p>
<p>my body feels strong</p>
<p>and believe me, in return</p>
<p>i’ll pass the kindness along</p>

<p>Mount Laguna to mile 63.7</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 22.2 (35.5km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 63.7 (101.9km)</p>
<p>I don’t remember the last time I slept so well! 8.5h of continuous sleep! On top of that, I had pizza for breakfast 🍕🤤! Perfect start of the day!</p>
<p>I started hiking at 6:30 and a few minutes later, I heard someone behind me calling my name. It was Max, the french dude that I hiked with on the first day.</p>
<p>We hiked together for the whole morning. By 10am we had hiked already 10 miles. 10 before 10! We kept this pace until 12:30 when we stopped to eat. After one hour or so I left Max behind and kept hiking for 3 more hours until I found a quite crowded campsite. It’s going to be my first night wild camping on the PCT! It’s crazy windy over here up the mountains 🌬️⛰️ !</p>
<p>Tomorrow it’s going to be a challenging day. I want to hike 21.6 miles to get a better campsite. The problem is that there’s only one water source. But they say sometimes magic happen on that stretch to provide water. We’ll see! 🪄💧</p>
<p>Because I finished the day early (and I don’t have internet!) I’m listening to music for the first time since I arrived in San Diego!</p>
<p>Oh, also, I found out today that I have a blister. I’m calling her Bloopu. Short for Blood Pudding.</p>

<p>Lake Morena to Mount Laguna</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 21.5 (34.4km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 41.5 (66.4km)</p>
<p>I woke up at 6 and I was starving. I spoiled myself with a 2-course breakfast. First I had a cup noodles. After that, I had fruit punch gatorade soaked granola, served on the unwashed noodles cup. I call it electronola! Delicious 😗👌!</p>
<p>At 8 I started walking and the day was much cooler than yesterday. By 12 I had walked 10 miles already.  The path was fun with some “river” crossings. And then, the heat showed up.</p>
<p>The afternoon was much tougher, not only because of the heat but also the ascend (it turns out that <em>Mount</em> Laguna is a mountain, who would have know?). I arrived at the recreational campground in Mount Laguna at 18:30 only to find out that it’s opening only next week. Since it was getting dark and cold, I was a little bit desperate. I asked some people around and they gave me a number of someone who could help me. I called and the lady told me she had a tiny house with no services (electricity, water) but I could have it for the night for $20. Tonight I’m sleeping like a king!</p>
<p>There’s also a restaurant nearby. After checking in at my beautiful tiny house, I had a salad (cheese salad apparently) and pizza!</p>
<p>I just realized that even though I met quite a few people (including a big group that I met at Scout and Frodo’s), I hiked most of the day alone. I must say that I really enjoyed my company.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I’m leaving with food for three days and the next resupply is 60 miles away, so I have to keep the same rhythm for these last two days — not an easy task.</p>

<p>PCT Southern Terminus to Lake Morena</p>
<p>PCT Miles: 20 (32km)</p>
<p>Total Miles: 20 (32km)</p>
<p>It’s happening!!</p>
<p>Today I went with Clara back to the Southern Terminus to take a proper PCT first day picture and to stick our arms to Mexico. We were blessed with a beautiful, beautiful sunrise!</p>
<p>After that we went back to Cleef to have breakfast. What a magical place! Some people cowboy camped (camping without a tent) and they were drying up their sleeping bags: because of the cold and condensation, their sleeping bags literally froze overnight 🥶. We had chocolate chips pancakes prepared by Papa Bear and headed out to our first PCT day!</p>
<p>Soon after we started, we were joined by a group of 4 people and the six of us hiked together for most of the day. If it’s not obvious, the desert is so hot and dry. The challenge for today was to constantly carry just the exact amount of water to reach the next water stream (and then, filter the necessary water to reach the next stream again). I drank around 6 liters of water during the hike (and drank 2 more now, arriving at camp).</p>
<p>Other than that, no major incidents. No rattlesnakes, no pooping in the wild yet. Just the last 5 miles were very exhausting because of the heat and the ascend to Lake Morena, where I’m staying tonight. We split the group and Clara stayed  a bit behind so I guess tomorrow I’ll be starting the day on my own 🐣.</p>
<p>I’m absolutely exhausted, but happy with the day. 2630 miles to go!</p>

<p>On the way, we stopped by at the local sports store to find the last-minute equipments and supplies. They had a nice Welcome section for PCTers.</p>
<p>At Cleef (the camping place where I’m spending the night today), I met Clara (Hi Clara!! 👋).</p>
<p>We set camp, had an awesome evening with burritos, beers and talks about the dangers of the PCT. Today I learned the rule number one of the PCT: don’t die. Noted ✅</p>

The book, written by Barney “Scout” Mann, tells his story about thru hiking the PCT in 2007 together with his wife, Frodo.</p>
<p>Since then, every spring they open their home in San Diego to host hikers from all over the world before they start their own PCT. I’m fortunate enough to be staying with them for the coming two nights.</p>
<p>After more than 12 hours flying (plus passport control, plus train, plus 40 minutes walking) I arrived at their house. As soon as I rang the bell, Rolling Thunder came to welcome me with the biggest smile. Right after him, I see Scout as he says “Welcome, Bruno. I’m glad to have you here”. A third person hands me a warm and fresh plate of food. I was completely (and positively) overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Around 25 hikers stay here every night during the hiking season. Scout and Frodo (with the help from other fantastic volunteers) cook dinner and breakfast for us every single day. They also receive packages, organize trips to the sports store and supermarket and give us tips and motivation to the adventure that’s about to start. After dinner Scout told us beautiful (and sad) stories about the PCT and urge us to be kind along the way. Frodo gave us the best advice possible: make wise decisions.</p>
<p>They don’t accept any kind of gift or donation (other than words). They say they’re fortunate enough to be able to do that and, in exchange, they ask us to be nice to each other and with the trail. They ask us to help any other hiker in need. They also remember us not to be afraid to ask for help when we need. And they make it very clear that, at some point during the PCT, everyone will need help.</p>
<p>Right now, I feel like I’m the luckiest person in the world. And I can only think of one word: gratitude.</p>

<p>It was my second winter living in Amsterdam, morning of January 27th 2017. At that time I was already planning my first long hike ever (Camino de Santiago) that was set to start in exact three months, but I had no idea that hiking would become one of my biggest passions in life.</p>
<p>Three years earlier (2014) when I still lived in Brazil, I met one of my best friends, Gabriela. During one of our first random conversations she asked me if I had heard about Creative Mornings. No, never, I said. She explained  to me what it was about and I decided to give it a try and went to a few events in São Paulo. Later, after moving to Amsterdam, I attended a few more (they organize events all around the world).</p>
<p>It was In one of these events (the fifth that I attended in Amsterdam) that Tim Voors, the speaker (that I had never heard about) of that event talked about the PCT (this crazy hike that I also had never heard about). I didn’t even know that this would be the subject of the talk when I subscribed to the event. As always, I wanted to attend because I enjoyed the vibe and the overall inspiration that the creative community brings together. At that time, I had no idea that all these things that I didn’t know combined were about to change my life forever.</p>
<p>I love these coincidences. I love these bits of inspiration that you can get because people decided to share their passions and their adventures with other — sometimes random — people. I love to find things that I didn’t know that I was looking for.</p>
<p>Thank you Gabriela for introducing me to Creative Mornings. Thank you Tim for sharing your story and inspiring random people like me (even though you don’t know me and you’re most likely not reading this 😅)</p>
<p>And thank you all for following this journey along with me. I hope I can also inspire some of you 💜</p>

<p>I’m gearing up for an epic journey: thru-hiking the Pacific Crest Trail, or PCT. Spanning over 4,200 kilometers, this trail stretches from the US/Mexican border in California to the US/Canadian border in Washington, traversing through three american states: California, Oregon, and Washington.</p>
<p>Thru-hiking the PCT is a massive undertaking that requires careful planning and preparation. It passes through a diverse range of landscapes, from desert valleys to snow-capped mountain peaks, and presents various challenges along the way, including steep ascents, unpredictable weather, and limited access to resources (like water and food 😅).</p>
<p>As I embark on this adventure, I’ll be sharing updates and insights about my journey, from the breathtaking scenery to the practical aspects of life on the trail. Stay tuned for updates as I tackle this incredible adventure from south to north, one step at a time!</p>
<p>Until then,</p>
<p>Bruno 🗺️</p>
