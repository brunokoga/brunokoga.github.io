I find it truly fascinating that I can make people’s lives better through software development and that’s what motivates me to keep learning and programming. My past experiences include working on a wide range of challenging international projects for large and small companies but also engagement in building a strong developer community in Brazil and writing technical articles.</p>

<h3 id="senior-ios-engineer--tech-lead-siilo">Senior iOS Engineer / Tech Lead, <a href="https://www.siilo.com">Siilo</a></h3>
<h5 id="amsterdam-the-netherlands-remote--jun-2020---mar-2023--2-yrs-10-mos">Amsterdam, The Netherlands (Remote) | Jun 2020 - Mar 2023 · 2 yrs 10 mos</h5>
<p>Evolving from my previous role, I became responsible not only for the development of the iOS app, but also for system-level technical decisions as well as hiring and onboarding processes. Between coding and guiding new-joiners, I also worked closely with the product management and design teams to technically evaluate and design the proposed new features.</p>
<p>For me, the main highlight of this role was the ability to learn and share knowledge with my colleagues (old and new). Siilo’s engineering team went from 6 to 30 people and I’m super happy to be part of this awesome talented multicultural team. And all of that while delivering high-quality software that is used by hundreds of thousands of healthcare professionals daily.</p>

<p>I’m very proud to say that I was the one who went on Xcode -> File -> New Project and created the Siilo app. Since then I’ve actively worked on the app as the lead developer for almost eight years.
Being the lead developer of the iOS Siilo app since day one, I was responsible for the implementation of the foundation and core features of the app, such as end-to-end encrypted messaging (including secure local storage and offline modes), voice and video calling, creation and handling of fully encrypted medical cases amongst many other features.</p>
<p>For 4.5 years I refined my knowledge not only in Swift but also in technologies like Reactive Programming (RxSwift and later Combine), encryption (NaCl) and Network sockets. And of course I made extensive use of Apple frameworks such as Foundation, UIKit (and later SwiftUI) and AVFoundation.</p>

When eBuddy became Siilo, the core engineering team stayed the same and with the previous knowledge of working on eBuddy’s messenger app, we started to develop what would be Europe’s largest and fastest growing secure messaging app and network platform for healthcare professionals.</p>
